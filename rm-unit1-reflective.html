            <h2>Ethics in Computing in the age of Generative AI</h2>
            <p>The exponential growth of AI research and industry, paired with the escalating demand for computational
                resources, poses a serious threat to global sustainability efforts (<a href="#reference1">Li, 2023</a>).
                The recent Financial Times article highlights the significant energy consumption and water usage
                associated with AI technologies, emphasising the urgent need for proactive measures to mitigate these
                environmental footprints (<a href="#reference5">Financial Times, 2024</a>). My stance on the
                environmental impacts of AI underscores the critical need for cross-border collaboration and government
                intervention to effectively mitigate these challenges. Given the global nature of AI research and
                development, sustainable practices must be implemented on a multinational scale to achieve meaningful
                results. The European Union (EU) provides a compelling example of how a governing body can drive change
                across multiple countries through regulatory frameworks and incentives (<a href="#reference6">Gailhofer,
                    2021</a>).</p>

            <p>To address the environmental footprint of AI, stakeholders must prioritise the use of renewable resources
                for both water and energy. It is estimated that the carbon footprint of training a single early large
                language model (LLM) such as GPT-2 takes about 300,000kg of CO2 emissions (<a
                    href="#reference10">Naughton, 2023</a>). For example, tech companies can invest in innovative
                cooling technologies for data centres that utilise recycled water or natural cooling methods, thereby
                reducing the strain on freshwater sources (<a href="#reference7">George AS, 2023</a>). Additionally,
                integrating renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power into AI operations can
                significantly reduce carbon emissions and reliance on fossil fuels.</p>

            <p>Cross-border collaboration is essential to facilitate the adoption of these sustainable practices.
                International agreements and partnerships can promote knowledge sharing, technology transfer, and best
                practices among countries, ensuring a coordinated approach to environmental stewardship in AI
                development (<a href="#reference2">Enger et al., 2021</a>). Moreover, multinational initiatives can pool
                resources and expertise to address common challenges, such as optimising energy efficiency and promoting
                renewable energy infrastructure.</p>

            <p>Government intervention plays a crucial role in driving the transition to sustainable AI practices.
                Regulatory measures can incentivise tech companies to prioritise environmental sustainability by
                offering tax incentives for investments in renewable energy infrastructure and imposing penalties for
                excessive energy consumption. Moreover, governments can mandate environmental impact assessments for AI
                projects, requiring companies to account for the carbon footprint and water usage associated with their
                operations.</p>

            <p>The EU's approach to regulating AI provides a blueprint for effective government intervention. Through
                initiatives such as the European Green Deal (<a href="#reference6">Gailhofer, 2021</a>) and the Digital
                Services Act, the EU aims to promote sustainable and ethical AI development while safeguarding the
                environment and consumer rights (<a href="#reference4">European Commission, 2024</a>). By implementing
                stringent regulations and promoting industry standards, the EU can influence global norms and practices
                in AI governance.</p>

            <p>However, addressing the environmental impacts of AI requires broader international cooperation beyond
                regional blocs like the EU. Collaborative efforts between governments, international organisations,
                academia, and civil society are needed to develop global standards and guidelines, through standard
                development organisations such as ISO, IEC, and IEEE, for sustainable AI development (<a
                    href="#reference2">Engler et al., 2021</a>). Platforms such as the United Nations and the World
                Economic Forum can serve as forums for dialogue and collaboration, facilitating the exchange of ideas
                and best practices on a global scale.</p>

            <p>Therefore, tackling the environmental impacts of AI necessitates a concerted effort involving
                cross-border collaboration and government intervention. By prioritising renewable resources,
                implementing regulatory frameworks, and fostering international cooperation, we can harness the
                transformative potential of AI while safeguarding the planet for future generations.</p>

            <p>The road to addressing these impacts is not without its obstacles. Current global conflicts and political
                differences could indeed pose significant roadblocks to effective collaboration and intervention.</p>

            <p>In today's geopolitical landscape, various conflicts and tensions exist among nations, driven by
                competing interests, divergent ideologies, and historical grievances (<a href="#reference16">United
                    Nations, 2022</a>). These conflicts can impede cooperation on issues such as environmental
                sustainability, as countries may prioritise their own national interests over collective goals.
                Additionally, political differences and ideological divides can lead to disagreements on the appropriate
                strategies for addressing environmental challenges, further complicating efforts to implement
                coordinated solutions (<a href="#reference13">Rotberg, 2010</a>).</p>

            <p>Moreover, certain geopolitical dynamics may hinder international collaboration on AI sustainability (<a
                    href="#reference15">Schmidt, 2022</a>). For example, tensions between major powers, such as the
                United States, China, and Russia, could limit cooperation on shared environmental goals, as these
                countries may view AI development as a strategic advantage in global competition (<a
                    href="#reference14">Ryan, 2022</a>). Additionally, differences in regulatory approaches and
                standards between regions may create barriers to harmonising policies and practices, undermining efforts
                to establish global norms for sustainable AI development (<a href="#reference2">Engler et al.,
                    2021</a>).</p>

            <p>The legal landscape surrounding AI and environmental sustainability is complex. Regulations often lag
                technological advancements, making it challenging to establish comprehensive frameworks for
                sustainability accreditation (<a href="#reference1">Brattberg, 2020</a>). Additionally, the cost of
                environmental innovation may pose a barrier for some companies, particularly smaller ones, which may
                struggle to fund these initiatives (<a href="#reference3">Escoto, 2022</a>). This could affect
                day-to-day life as a worker, potentially leading to job insecurity or changes in professional practices
                as companies adapt to new regulatory requirements and invest in sustainability measures.</p>

            <p>Diplomatic efforts, multilateral agreements, and confidence-building measures can help bridge divides and
                facilitate meaningful collaboration on AI sustainability.</p>

            <p>Additionally, engaging non-state actors, such as civil society organisations, academia, and the private
                sector, can complement government-led initiatives and drive bottom-up change. Grassroots movements and
                advocacy campaigns can raise awareness about the environmental impacts of AI and mobilise public support
                for sustainable practices (<a href="#reference11">Raj, 2022</a>). Furthermore, industry-led initiatives,
                such as voluntary sustainability certifications and corporate social responsibility programs, can
                incentivize companies to adopt environmentally friendly policies and technologies (<a
                    href="#reference9">Marx, 2020</a>).</p>

            <p>In conclusion, addressing the environmental impacts of AI requires a collaborative, multidimensional
                approach that acknowledges geopolitical, regulatory, and financial challenges. While initiatives like
                the EU's regulatory framework provide valuable precedents, significant hurdles remain, including
                geopolitical tensions and regulatory lag. However, by fostering international cooperation and
                innovation, stakeholders can navigate these challenges via evaluating and adapting existing frameworks,
                prioritizing renewable resources, and incentivising sustainable practices. Moreover, proactive
                engagement with non-state actors and grassroots movements is essential for mobilising public support and
                driving bottom-up change. Ultimately, by aiming to bridge geopolitical divides and prioritising
                cooperation, the international community can pave the way for a more sustainable future in AI
                development and deployment. Such efforts are crucial for harnessing AI's transformative potential while
                ensuring environmental stewardship for generations to come.</p>
