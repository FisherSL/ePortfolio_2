                <h2>Reflecting on Unit 5</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>Unit 5 explored the use of interviews, survey methods, and questionnaire design, offering
                        insights into qualitative and quantitative data collection techniques. These methods play a
                        crucial role in gathering comprehensive data for research purposes, providing valuable insights
                        into opinions, trends, and behaviors.</p>
                    <p>In-depth interviews emerged as a prominent qualitative research method, facilitating one-on-one
                        conversations with respondents to gather detailed information and insights. Conversely, surveys
                        serve as a vital quantitative data collection method, offering accessibility and scalability for
                        exploring diverse opinions and trends.</p>
                    <p>The distinction between questionnaires and surveys was elucidated, emphasising the former as a
                        research instrument encompassing a set of questions for data collection. Questionnaires offer
                        flexibility in data gathering and can be administered through various mediums, including online,
                        phone, or face-to-face interactions.</p>
                    <p>Unit 5 underscored the significance of proper questionnaire design and survey methods to ensure
                        the effectiveness of data collection. Understanding the types of questions and their suitability
                        for qualitative or quantitative research is crucial for obtaining accurate and reliable data.

                    <p>Unit 5 has equipped me with practical knowledge and skills essential for conducting effective
                        interviews, surveys, and questionnaire-based research, while fostering critical reflection on
                        ethical considerations in data collection.</p>
                    <h2>So what?</h2>
                    <p>The most significant aspect of Unit 5's tasks was the opportunity for both independent learning
                        and collaborative engagement. Engaging in solo lecturecasts and readings provided foundational
                        knowledge, while collaborative activities like the wiki examination offered real-world insights
                        into questionnaire design.</p>
                    <p>This unit underscored the importance of ethical considerations in research, particularly in the
                        era of digital misinformation and privacy concerns. Reflecting on the Cambridge Analytica
                        scandal offered valuable insights into the ethical implications of data collection methods and
                        their societal impact, informing future research practices.</p>
                    <h2>What next?</h2>
                    <p>From these experiences, I have gained a deeper understanding of the complexities involved in data
                        collection and questionnaire design, as well as the ethical considerations inherent in research.
                        Moving forward, I aim to apply these insights to my future research endeavors as I plan to
                        incorporate this ethical analysis of misinformation in digital spaces, as part of my final
                        project, ensuring
                        meticulous questionnaire design and ethical conduct in data collection practices.</p>
