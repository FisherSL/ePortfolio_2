                    <p>I was surprised that a limitation of open questions did not include the fact that they are much less likely to be answered, since this would certainly be my inclination if presented with them. A brief literature search confirmed that respondents are less likely to respond if the questionnaire contains open questions (Saleh & Bista, 2017).</p>
                    <p>The case study based on the Cambridge Analytica scandal was very interesting and I spent a great deal of time researching it. I only knew about it from media coverage at the time but the more I read, the more interested I became and the more incredulous I was at the total contempt for data privacy by Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. The repercussions have been severe and fully deserved in my opinion and demonstrates the need for big tech to be held to account, and the importance of data protection legislation.</p>
