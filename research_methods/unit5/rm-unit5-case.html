                <h3>Case Study: Inappropriate Use of Surveys: Cambridge Analytica</h3>

                <p>In 2018, a small UK firm, Cambridge Analytica, became the centre of worldwide media coverage because of an article published in the Guardian newspaper (Cadwalladr, 2018). The controversy surrounded the fact that Cambridge Analytica had used the illegally obtained data of over 87 million Facebook users to target them on behalf of the political campaigns of Ted Cruz and Donald Trump in the US in 2016. This targeting involved creating psychographic profiles to send information to them that would most likely influence their voting behaviour in a particular way (Lewis & Hilder, 2018; Svitek & Samsel, 2018). There were also suggestions that the data had been used to influence voters in the 2016 UK Brexit referendum, although this was later dismissed by the official enquiry in the UK (ICO, 2020)</p>

                <p>The controversy centres on the way in which the data was obtained. A lifestyle survey app, which users were paid a small fee to complete, requested consent from respondents to access their Facebook profiles. The app then harvested a wide range of data from these profiles and those of their friends (ICO, 2018a).</p>

                <p>The fallout from what has become known as the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal has had far reaching repercussions, some of which are outlined below:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Facebook was given the maximum fine allowable at the time (£500,000) for its part in the scandal (ICO, 2018b).</li>
                        <li>Facebook have also been fined in the United States: $5 billion by the Federal Trade Commission (Wong, 2019) and the $100 million by the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC.gov, 2019).</li>
                        <li>Other enforcement action has been completed or is ongoing around the world e.g. Australia fined Facebook A$20 million (Kaye, 2023).</li>
                        <li>As a result of the scandal. Cambridge Analytica and its parent company filed for bankruptcy in the UK and US (Reuters, 2018).</li>
                        <li>An investigation by the UK Parliament called for urgent updating of the UK’s digital laws to control big tech companies (Pegg, 2019).</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>Another example of inappropriate use of survey data is that by the US government after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbour. The US government secretly used data from the 1940 census to locate, remove and inter Japanese Americans during World War II (Aratani, 2018). This abuse of power resonated more recently when the US government proposed including a question regarding citizenship in the 2020 census. This was the subject of legal challenge on the grounds that the data could be misused to target illegal immigrants. The Supreme Court eventually ruled against its inclusion (Wolf, 2019).</p>
