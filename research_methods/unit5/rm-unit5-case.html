                <h2>Case Study: Inappropriate Use of Surveys</h2>
                <p>In 2018, Cambridge Analytica was in the news in the United Kingdom and the USA (Confessore, 2018) for
                    obtaining and sharing data obtained from millions of Facebook users. They obtained the data through
                    innocuous surveys on Facebook (you may have seen this type of survey and probably participated at
                    times). This is probably the highest profile of surveys used for alternative means and, probably,
                    monetary gains. However, this happens often through various media.</p>
                <p>Consider how exactly this happened and why it was used. Find one or two further examples of
                    inappropriate use of surveys and highlight the impact of all these examples from the various
                    ethical, social, legal, and professional standpoints that apply.</p>
                <p>Record your findings in your e-Portfolio. You can also submit your findings to your tutor for
                    formative feedback.</p>
                <hr>
                <h3>The Case of Cambridge Analytica</h3>
                <p>The case of Cambridge Analytica's inappropriate use of surveys serves as a prominent example of how
                    surveys can be misused for unethical purposes. Here's a breakdown of how it happened and its
                    impacts:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Data Obtained Through Innocuous Surveys:</strong> Cambridge Analytica obtained data from
                        millions of Facebook users by using innocuous surveys. Users were often enticed to participate
                        in these surveys without fully understanding the implications of sharing their personal
                        information (Boldyreva, 2018).</li>
                    <li><strong>Unethical Data Sharing:</strong> The data collected through these surveys were then used
                        for purposes beyond what was disclosed to the participants. Cambridge Analytica allegedly used
                        this data to create psychographic profiles of individuals for political targeting and
                        manipulation purposes, without obtaining proper consent or informing users about how their data
                        would be used (Boldyreva, 2018).</li>
                    <li><strong>Impact:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Ethical Impact:</strong> The unethical collection and use of personal data raise
                                serious ethical concerns about privacy, consent, and transparency. Users' trust in
                                online platforms and survey methodologies can be significantly eroded (Wilson, 2019).
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Social Impact:</strong> The manipulation of individuals' data for political
                                purposes can undermine democratic processes and lead to social polarisation (Hinds et
                                al., 2020; Heawood, 2018). It can also contribute to the spread of misinformation and
                                the amplification of divisive narratives (van der Linden, 2023).</li>
                            <li><strong>Legal Impact:</strong> The unauthorised access and misuse of personal data may
                                violate data protection laws and regulations, leading to legal repercussions for the
                                responsible parties.</li>
                            <li><strong>Professional Impact:</strong> The scandal highlights the importance of ethical
                                conduct and professional responsibility in data collection and analysis practices. It
                                underscores the need for researchers and organisations to adhere to ethical guidelines
                                and standards when conducting surveys and handling sensitive data.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Further Examples of Inappropriate Use of Surveys</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Online Scams:</strong> Some individuals or organisations may use surveys as a guise to
                        collect personal information for fraudulent purposes, such as identity theft or financial scams.
                        For example, phishing surveys disguised as legitimate market research studies may trick
                        participants into revealing sensitive information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Employment Discrimination:</strong> Surveys administered by employers or hiring agencies
                        may be used to gather discriminatory information about job applicants, such as age, race,
                        gender, or disability status. This information could then be used to make biased hiring
                        decisions, leading to discrimination and inequality in the workplace.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>In conclusion, the inappropriate use of surveys, as exemplified by the Cambridge Analytica scandal
                    and other instances, has far-reaching ethical, social, legal, and professional implications. It
                    underscores the importance of safeguarding individuals' privacy rights, promoting transparency and
                    accountability in data collection practices, and upholding ethical standards in research and data
                    analysis.</p>
