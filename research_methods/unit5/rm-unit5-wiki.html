                <h2>Questionnaire Critique: Cybersecurity</h2>
                <h3>Cybersecurity (CSEC) Questionnaire & Critique</h3>
                <p>The Cybersecurity (CSEC) Questionnaire is a tool developed to assess individual differences in
                    unintentional insider threat behaviours related to cybersecurity practices. Created by Schoenherr
                    and Thomson in 2021, the questionnaire aims to identify basic vulnerabilities in users' practices,
                    including updating software, changing passwords, and disclosure of information on social media
                    platforms.</p>
                <h4>Overview:</h4>
                <p>The CSEC Questionnaire consists of six main sections:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Demographics:</strong> Collects information about respondents' age, computer usage in
                        their jobs, and professional background in information sciences.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cybersecurity Training:</strong> Assesses the amount of cybersecurity training
                        respondents have received.</li>
                    <li><strong>Likert Scale:</strong> Uses a scale of 1 to 5 to measure respondents' agreement with
                        statements related to cybersecurity practices, including internet usage, application updates,
                        password management, and social media usage.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Usage:</h4>
                <p>The questionnaire is designed to be administered to individuals to gather data on their cybersecurity
                    behaviour and attitudes. It can be used in research studies, organisational assessments, and
                    personnel evaluations to identify individuals who may need additional education and training in
                    cybersecurity practices.</p>
                <h4>Development and Validation:</h4>
                <p>The CSEC Questionnaire was developed based on existing scales assessing individual differences, such
                    as conscientiousness, extraversion, and openness. It has been validated through empirical research
                    to demonstrate its reliability, validity, and relevance in assessing cybersecurity behaviours.</p>
                <h4>Conclusion:</h4>
                <p>Overall, the CSEC Questionnaire serves as a valuable tool for assessing individual cybersecurity
                    practices and identifying potential vulnerabilities that may contribute to unintentional insider
                    threats. Its simplicity, relevance, and effectiveness make it a useful instrument in various
                    contexts, including research, organisational assessments, and personnel evaluations.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Clarity and Simplicity:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The questions are generally clear and easy to understand, with straightforward response
                                options.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Relevance:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The questions appear relevant to the study's objectives, focusing on individual
                                characteristics, cybersecurity practices, and demographics.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Completeness:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The questionnaire covers a range of relevant aspects, including age, computer usage,
                                profession, cybersecurity training, and attitudes towards cybersecurity practices.</li>
                            <li>However, consider including open-ended questions: In addition to closed-ended questions,
                                consider including some open-ended questions to allow respondents to provide more
                                detailed insights or explanations, especially regarding their cybersecurity practices
                                and attitudes.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Balance:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The questions seem balanced in terms of positive and negative phrasing, with a mix of
                                positively and negatively worded statements in the Likert scale section.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Response Options:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The response options are appropriate and cover a range of possibilities for each
                                question.</li>
                            <li>However, there could be a risk of response bias due to the lack of a neutral option in
                                the Likert scale section.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Format:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The format is consistent throughout the questionnaire, making it easy to follow.</li>
                            <li>The Likert scale questions could benefit from numbering to improve clarity and
                                organisation.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Length:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The length of the questionnaire seems reasonable, neither too long nor too short,
                                considering the complexity of the topic.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Pilot Testing:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There's no mention of pilot testing in the provided information, but it would be
                                beneficial to pilot test the questionnaire to ensure clarity, relevance, and
                                comprehensibility.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Overall, the questionnaire appears to be a solid tool for gathering data on cybersecurity behaviour
                    and individual characteristics. However, some minor adjustments, such as adding numbering to Likert
                    scale questions, could improve its effectiveness. Additionally, pilot testing would help identify
                    any potential issues before full-scale implementation.</p>
