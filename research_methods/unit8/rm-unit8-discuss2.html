                <h4>Peer Comment</h4>

                <p>Hi Steve, thanks for your post.<br><br> Do you not think that Abi should follow his discretion when presenting data that he knows will produce conflicting results (Eubank, 2022)? Especially, when he seems to have a sense of what the findings should report.<br><br>

 

                References:</p>
                    
                <p>Eubank, N. (2022) Researcher Discretion in Descriptive Analysis. Available from: https://www.unifyingdatascience.org/html/descriptive_questions.html [Accessed 19 June 2024].</p>

                <h4>My Response</h4>

                <p>You raise an interesting point and after reading the reference provided I don't think that what I said in my original post is contradicted by it.</p>

                <p>Abi has a responsibility to perform all relevant and statistically correct analyses provided he is open about his reasons for performing them and provides sufficient context for a reader to judge the effects of their outcomes. Now, if the more favorable analysis goes against this, then of course he should refuse to provide it on the grounds that it is not statistically appropriate for the data set. What do you think?</p>
                    
                <p>Do we need more information than we have to make a more nuanced argument?</p>

                <h4>Peer Comment</h4>

                <p>Your post makes a well-rounded argument about Abi's ethical responsibilities as a researcher and statistical programmer, but it could address potential ethical dilemmas more effectively. For instance, it could discuss the possibility of misleading analyses if taken out of context. According to Søbjerg et al. (2020), ethical statistical practice requires accurate and precise findings to prevent misuse. Abi must ensure that the presentation of the findings does not unintentionally endorse deceptive conclusions, even if the data is correct (Correia, 2023).</p>

                <p>Moreover, it is essential to consider the implications of reporting potential misuse to regulatory bodies like the ASA, FSA, or Trading Standards. As Dittrich et al. (2013) point out, this step can have substantial legal and professional repercussions. Abi should be prepared to substantiate his claims with robust evidence (Burr & Leslie, 2021).</p>
                    
                <p>Furthermore, by exploring the larger international context rather than just concentrating on the UK setting, your post could provide a more comprehensive and nuanced view of Abi's ethical, professional, and legal predicament. Since moral and legal norms differ significantly between nations (Stewart, 2020).</p>
                    
                <p>Last but not least, I wanted to address your In-text citation, "(Royal Statistical Society (2019)," which seems non-compliant with the Harvard Referencing Guide. However, the study skills chatbot is an excellent resource for quickly looking up how to cite and reference. I have been trying to improve my referencing since your last observation.</p>

                <h4>My Response</h4>

                <p>Many thanks for your comments on my post. I certainly agree that widening the scope by considering other jurisdictions would have enhanced my post (something for my summary post I should think).</p>

                <p>I find the comments in your first paragraph thought provoking as the way you have cited them seems to go against my personal instincts that analysis in this case should be completely open and without bias. If Abi is using his personal bias (i.e. because he thinks the company is trying to 'spin' the data in a more positive light) to not present all possible avenues of analysis, is that not unethical of Abi?</p>
                    
                <p>Also, I don't think that including the more favourable analysis in the report (along with the less favourable) goes against Søbjerg et al. (2020) - what do you think?</p>
                    
                <p>Finally, I am glad you found my suggestions regarding referencing in discussion 1 helpful. The bot is indeed useful although it does have the odd issue so it's always useful to check the printed guide e.g. it will often say to use Avalaible 'at' when we should use 'from'. Well done for spotting my citation error! It's no excuse, but that was an editing error when I changed the structure of the original paragraph.</p>

                <h4>Further response from this peer</h4>

                <p>I appreciate your willingness to consider expanding the scope of your summary post. Including other jurisdictions can provide a more comprehensive perspective.</p>

                <p>I understand your point about the importance of complete openness in data analysis. I agree that it is crucial for Abi to be transparent and unbiased and to present all possible avenues of analysis without letting personal biases interfere. My concern is ensuring that each analysis is communicated clearly to prevent misinterpretation, especially when different analyses might lead to various conclusions. This relates to the clarity and context of these analyses (Kleinheksel et al. 2020).</p>
                    
                <p>Regarding Søbjerg et al. (2020), I also agree with your perspective. Including favourable and less favourable analyses in the report does not necessarily contradict their principles. The key is to ensure that Abi presents these analyses accurately without endorsing misleading conclusions (Afonso et al. 2023).</p>
                    
                <p>As for the referencing issue, I understand it was an editing error because you show that you are an expert. Since your last observations on my referencing, for which I am grateful, I have learned that double-checking is always good to ensure accuracy.</p>

                <h4>Peer Comment</h4>

                <p>Thank you, Steve, for your post discussing Abi’s ethical considerations and potential recourse for misuse, as well as the applicable regulatory law for your region. While you succinctly raise valid points, some changes would strengthen your argument.</p>

                <p>I think you mean Abi’s suggestions of different analytical techniques to attain specific results are ‘unethical’ as opposed to ‘ethical’ (Fisher, 2024). (My personal trick is to use Microsoft Word’s ‘Read Aloud’ under the ‘Review’ tab to catch these.) It would also be stronger if you named the numbered code of conduct which Abi might breach. For instance, the British Computing Society (BCS) (N.D.) Code of Conduct principle 3(e) mentions product performance misrepresentation. Furthermore, your assertion that adherence to ethical requirements by Abi’s report is sufficient to protect him from enforcement would be better substantiated by a citation.</p>
                    
                <p>While your observation that the Advertising Standards Authority, Food Standards Agency, or Trading Standards could be used is helpful, it would be strengthened by citations to those organisations and inclusion of region. For example, the Food Standards Agency (N.D.) is the United Kingdom’s (UK) regulatory authority for reporting food quality and safety misrepresentation. This would be further strengthened by an academic source on reporting ethical breaches.</p>
                    
                <p>Similarly, your conclusion on the European Union (EU) regulation and UK law is insightful, however, it too would benefit from citation.</p>

                <h4>My Response</h4>

                <p>Many thanks for your response and here are my thoughts:
                    <ul>
                        <li>You are incorrect in your assumption that I meant 'unethical'. I was pointing out that it his responsibility to analyse the data in all possible ways. Do you think that by omitting the method which would put the data in a more favourable light Abi could be accused of bias?</li>
                        <li>I agree that citing the relevant code violations in more detail would enhance my argument.</li>
                        <li>I also agree that if I could find specific, relevant case law, my point regarding Abi's defence would be enhanced. Unfortunately I was unable to find any within the time constraints I had.</li>
                        <li>Regarding your comments about Abi's options, I do make it clear that these organisations are in the UK '...he has several options in the UK depending on the manner of misuse...". I didn't feel a citation was required in this context in text hyperlinks to the relevant websites would have been useful, I agree.</li>
                        <li>I am confused about your comment regarding citation of the UK legislation . It is cited and referenced although perhaps the fact that it is in italics is the crux of your objection?. If you disagree, please feel free to expand on your comment.</li>
                    </ul>
