                <h2>Reflecting on Unit 8</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>Unit 8 shifted the focus from research methods to data analysis and visualisation. This unit
                        highlighted the differences between handling quantitative and qualitative data and explored
                        various ways to analyse and present them effectively.</p>
                    <p>Qualitative data, made up of observations, images, and words, is more subjective and open to
                        interpretation, making it harder to remain unbiased. Coding responses and using software for
                        efficient analysis are crucial steps. On the other hand, quantitative data analysis involves
                        clear stages of data preparation and analysis.</p>
                    <p>Data visualisation is an important aspect of data presentation. Dashboards, as suggested by
                        Microsoft (2023), help in organising and displaying important information at a glance, providing
                        actionable insights for businesses.</p>
                    <h2>Key Takeaways:</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Qualitative Data Analysis:</strong> Understanding the coding and categorisation of
                            qualitative data for better interpretation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Quantitative Data Analysis:</strong> Recognising the clear distinction between data
                            preparation and analysis stages.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Visualisation:</strong> Learning the importance of dashboards and various
                            charts to present data effectively.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h2>Summary of Activities</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Solo Reading:</strong> Engaged in individual reading to understand different types
                            of data analysis and visualisation techniques.</li>
                        <li><strong>Worksheets:</strong> Completed worksheets related to data inference and chart
                            creation using Excel, reinforcing practical skills.</li>
                        <li><strong>Research Proposal Outline:</strong> Missed the opportunity to submit a research
                            proposal outline due to time constraints, but managed to keep up with other activities.</li>
                        <li><strong>Seminar Preparation:</strong> Prepared for the seminar by working on charts
                            worksheets in Excel, enhancing my understanding of data inference.</li>
                        <li><strong>Seminar Recording:</strong> Watched the seminar recording, which was crucial for
                            grasping the concepts of data inference and visualisation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Unit 8 provided valuable insights into data analysis and visualisation. Although I missed some
                        opportunities due to time constraints, the worksheets and seminar recordings were beneficial in
                        strengthening my understanding.</p>
                    <h2>So what?</h2>
                    <p>The unit emphasised the importance of effectively analysing and presenting both qualitative and
                        quantitative data. Balancing multiple tasks remains a challenge, but engaging with seminar
                        recordings and practical worksheets helped in understanding key concepts.</p>
                    <h2>What next?</h2>
                    <p>Going forward, I aim to refine my skills in data analysis and visualisation. I will focus on
                        managing my time more effectively to ensure I can participate fully in all activities. The
                        insights gained from this unit will be crucial for my future research projects, especially in
                        presenting data clearly and effectively.</p>
