                <h2>Unit 8: Research Proposal Plan</h2>

                <p>The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) 3.0 has attracted criticism by several authors e.g. Chester (2021); Howland (2023); Spring et al. (2023)<br><br>
                    Among other things, the paper by Howland (2023) tested the hypothesis that vulnerabilities (CVEs) with higher CVSS scores should have been weaponised more than those with lower ones i.e. the relationship should be linear. He based this hypothesis on the fact that according to CVSS, the higher the score, the higher the risk (there is some interesting background here around ‘severity’ and ‘risk’ and the original intention of use of CVSS scores). His analysis proved that this was not the case as shown in the chart below. Please note this is a direct copy of the chart from his paper.

                    <p>A new version, CVSS 4.0, was released 1/11/23 and is now at v1.2 as of 18/6/24. It claims to address the criticisms levelled at CVSS 3.0. and be more suited to calculating ‘risk’.</p>

                    <p>In my research there has been no attempt yet to apply CVSS 4.0 to retrospective data in the way that Howland (2023) did. If this was done, a direct comparison between the two data sets could be made to see if CVSS 4.0 is more suited to calculating ‘risk’ than CVSS 3.0 was i.e. what is the type of relationship between CVSS scores of CVEs and the number weaponised CVE’s? Is it more linear than it was for CVSS 3.0? (which it should be if the authors claims are true).</p>

                    <p>To facilitate this analysis, a test of significance could be performed between the results of the two data sets (CVSS 3.0 against CVSS 4.0). A test of correlation could also be performed between the number of CVEs weaponised and the CVSS 4.0 scores if graphical presentation suggested there might be one. The important point here is to recognise that CVSS scores are ordinal, hence non-parametric tests are appropriate.</p>
