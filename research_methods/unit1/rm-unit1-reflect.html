                    <p>As a trained scientist (my first degree is in biology) I am familiar with the concept of the scientific method, but I admit to struggling with the distinctions between deductive & inductive reasoning as explained in this unit (UoEO, 2024). Despite reading more on the subject, I still can’t get 100% on the quiz! However, after reading Zegarelli (2021), I think the issue here is that my brain is strongest when thinking logically since I have focussed on the scientific method all my educational and professional life (as a science teacher). Since logic and deductive reasoning are closely related, I have difficulty grasping inductive reasoning as it has a high potential to be logically flawed.</p>

                    <p>Going forward I need to continue to read around types of reasoning until I find an explanation that works for me. I will then see if I can get 100% on the quiz!</p>
