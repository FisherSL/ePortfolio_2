                <h3>Initial Post</h3>
                <p>The case study around which the discussion is based can be found <a href="https://ethics.acm.org/code-of-ethics/using-the-code/case-malware-disruption/">here.</a></p>

                <p>Rogue Services, in providing a platform for fraudulent services and refusing requests to remove such services are in breach of the following sections of the British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct (BCS, 2022):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sections 1 (a) and (b)</li>
                    <li>Section 2 (f)</li>
                    <li>Section 4 (a), (c) & (d)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The security vendors involved, whilst acting to uphold the principles of part 1(a), are clearly in breach of part 1(b) and possibly part 2(f) as legitimate customer data was deleted. Additionally, depending on your point of view, these vendors could also be in breach of parts 4(a) and (c) since the creation and distribution of malware in these circumstances presents an ethical dichotomy (Withers et al., 2020). Cobb & Lee (2014), suggest that the use of malicious code for any reason should be discouraged due to unintended consequences, loss of control and possible legal challenges. More recently however, researchers have concluded that there is need for this kind of offensive security practice (Conteh, 2021) with a focus on developing effective techniques (Almehmadi et al., 2022) and frameworks for training in their application (Heiding & Lagerström, 2020).</p>

                <p>Ethical considerations notwithstanding, it is important to note that the security vendors and government organisations must have acted lawfully. Whilst Part 5 of the Investigatory Powers Act (2016) allows for ‘Equipment Interference’ by authorised persons in possession of a valid warrant. The control of who, and in what circumstances such warrants can be issued are tightly controlled and outlined in Part 5 sections 102-128. Without such authorisation, the entities involved including any law enforcement, could be found in breach of the Computer Misuse Act (1990) Sections 1, 3 and 3A. In the absence of any breach of criminal statute, legitimate users of Rogue Services may have a case in civil law under the tort of negligence, to sue for damages as a result of their data being destroyed. The only caveat being is that at present, this is a legal grey area since digital files are not yet recognised as property. However, there have been moves in this direction in judgements by the courts (Michaels & Millard, 2022) and the UK Government are currently consulting on draft legislation to allow digital assets to be recognised as property in law (Law Commission, 2024).</p>
