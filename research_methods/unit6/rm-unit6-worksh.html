                <h2>Interpretation of Findings</h2>
                <p>
                    For Diet A, the sample size is 50 individuals with a mean weight loss of approximately 5.34 units
                    and a standard deviation of approximately 2.54 units.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For Diet B, also with a sample size of 50 individuals, the mean weight loss is approximately 3.71
                    units, with a standard deviation of approximately 2.77 units.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Comparing the two diets, we observe that Diet A tends to result in higher weight loss on average
                    compared to Diet B. However, Diet B shows greater variability in weight loss outcomes as indicated
                    by the higher standard deviation. Further analysis is required to determine the statistical
                    significance of these differences and identify potential factors influencing the effectiveness of
                    each diet.

                <p>
                    For Diet A, the sample size is 50 individuals with a mean weight loss of approximately 5.341 units
                    and a standard deviation of approximately 2.536 units. The median weight loss is 5.642 units, with
                    the first quartile (Q1) at 3.748 units and the third quartile (Q3) at 7.033 units. The interquartile
                    range (IQR) is approximately 3.285 units.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For Diet B, also with a sample size of 50 individuals, the mean weight loss is approximately 3.710
                    units, with a standard deviation of approximately 2.769 units. The median weight loss is 3.745
                    units, with the first quartile (Q1) at 1.953 units and the third quartile (Q3) at 5.4035 units. The
                    interquartile range (IQR) is approximately 3.4505 units.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Comparing the two diets, Diet A has a higher mean, median, and interquartile range compared to Diet
                    B, indicating potentially better weight loss outcomes and less variability in results. However, a
                    comprehensive evaluation of diet effectiveness would require further analysis and consideration of
                    factors beyond these summary statistics.

                <p>
                    In Area 1, the most preferred brand among respondents is "Other" with 60% frequency, followed by
                    brand B with 24.3% and brand A with 15.7%. This suggests a diverse preference pattern with a
                    majority favoring brands categorised as "Other".
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, in Area 2, brand B emerges as the most preferred with 33.33% frequency, followed
                    closely by brand A with 21.11%. Brand "Other" still holds a significant portion of preferences at
                    45.56%. Unlike in Area 1, where the majority preferred "Other" brands, in Area 2, brand B seems to
                    be more popular.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The analysis indicates varying brand preferences between the two demographic areas, suggesting that
                    brand effectiveness or marketing strategies may need to be tailored to each specific area to
                    maximise brand engagement and market share.
