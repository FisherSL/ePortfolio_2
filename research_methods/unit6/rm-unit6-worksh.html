                <h3>Summary Measures Worksheet: Exercise 6.1</h3>

                <h4>Interpretation</h4>
                <p>
                    Since the mean weight loss of diet A is larger than diet B we can say that diet A was more effective overall. Since the sd of diet A is lower than diet B, there is less variation in the weight loss i.e. more people had a weight loss closer to the mean for diet A than diet B. Since the mean of diet B (3.71) is much less than 2 sds (5.538) less of a proportion of individuals had a positive weigh loss indicating diet B was less effective.<br><br>
                    
                    It is important to note that since both mean and sd are affected by outliers, some measure of the range of the data would be useful. Also since sd assumes normally distributed data, this would also need to be confirmed.

                <img src="Stats_Exercise_6_2.png">
                <h4>Interpretation</h4>
                <p>
                    The median weight loss for diet B is less than diet A (3.745 against 5.642), hence it is not as effective. Since the IQR for diet B is higher than diet A, the results are less consistent since IQR measures the spread of the middle 50% of the data points.

                <h4>Interpretation</h4>
                <p>In area 2, most people preferred another brand of cereal (45.6%) with the next preferred being brand B (33.3%) and brand A the least popular (21.1%).  This trend in preference follows the same pattern as area 1 but both cereal A & B were more popular in area 2 than area 1 with less people preferring another brand.
