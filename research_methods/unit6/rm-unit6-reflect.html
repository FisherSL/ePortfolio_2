                    <p>Unit 6 explored quantitative methods, focusing on descriptive statistics to summarise numerical
                        data effectively. This unit provided essential insights into the levels of measurement and
                        measures of location and spread, laying the groundwork for understanding and applying
                        quantitative analysis techniques.</p>
                    <p>Quantitative methods involve examining relationships between variables measured numerically,
                        facilitating analysis through various statistical and graphical techniques. The unit emphasised
                        the importance of valid methodology for variables of interest, emphasizing the distinction
                        between levels of measurement.</p>
                    <p>Descriptive statistics emerged as a central focus, offering methods to summarize data effectively
                        through graphical summaries and summary measures of location and spread. Excel worksheets
                        provided practical exercises to reinforce learning, though navigating the VLE layout for
                        resources posed challenges.</p>

                            <strong>Solo Reading:</strong> Engaged in solo reading to explore quantitative methods and
                            descriptive statistics. This independent study provided foundational knowledge for
                            understanding numerical data analysis techniques.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Excel Worksheets:</strong> Completed statistical worksheets using Excel, reinforcing
                            learning through practical exercises. However, navigating the VLE layout for resources
                            proved challenging and sometimes counterintuitive, detracting from the learning experience.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Unit 6 has equipped me with essential knowledge and skills for conducting quantitative analysis,
                        laying the foundation for future exploration of inferential statistics and advanced data
                        analysis techniques.</p>
                    <h2>So what?</h2>
                    <p>The most significant aspect of Unit 6 was the opportunity to gain practical experience in
                        quantitative analysis through Excel worksheets as I have been out of practice. Despite
                        challenges with resource navigation, the
                        exercises provided valuable hands-on learning.</p>
                    <h2>What next?</h2>
                    <p>Building on the knowledge gained in Unit 6, I aim to further explore statistics and
                        advanced data analysis techniques. Additionally, I will seek opportunities to enhance my
                        proficiency in Excel and navigate the VLE more effectively to optimise learning experiences.</p>
