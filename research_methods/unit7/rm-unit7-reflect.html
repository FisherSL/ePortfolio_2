                <h2>Reflecting on Unit 7</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>Unit 7 explored quantitative methods, focusing on inferential statistics and hypothesis testing.
                        This unit provided insights into using statistical inference to draw conclusions about
                        populations from sample data, along with the basics of probability and hypothesis testing.</p>
                    <p>Inferential statistics aims to derive patterns and properties about a larger group by studying a
                        smaller sample. This involves extracting meaningful insights from data while acknowledging
                        uncertainty. Hypothesis testing emerged as a method to evaluate assumptions about population
                        values based on sample data.</p>
                    <h2>Key Takeaways:</h2>

                            workload alongside other tasks was challenging.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Unit 7 provided valuable insights into inferential statistics and hypothesis testing. However,
                        managing workload alongside other commitments was challenging. Reflecting on the experience,
                        adjustments may be necessary to ensure a balanced workload and optimal learning outcomes.</p>
                    <h2>So what?</h2>
                    <p>The workload intensity of Unit 7 posed challenges in managing multiple tasks within a single
                        week, impacting engagement with collaborative discussions and allocation of time to the
                        literature review. Balancing workload with part-time studies and full-time work remains a key
                        consideration for future units.</p>
                    <h2>What next?</h2>
                    <p>Building on the knowledge gained in Unit 7, I aim to further refine my understanding of
                        inferential statistics and hypothesis testing, applying these techniques to future research
                        projects. Additionally, I will seek strategies to manage workload more effectively and
                        prioritise tasks to ensure optimal learning outcomes, although I do think this needs to be
                        refined by the course leaders too.</p>
