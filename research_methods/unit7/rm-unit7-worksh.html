                <h2>Summary Measures Worksheet: Exercise 7.2 Income Comparison</h2>
                <p>I conducted an analysis to determine whether the population mean income for males exceeds that of
                    females using the provided bank cardholder data. Here's the detailed process I followed:</p>

                <h2>Formulating the Hypotheses</h2>
                <p>
                    I started by formulating the hypotheses:
                <ul>
                    <li>Null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>): &mu;<sub>M</sub> &le; &mu;<sub>F</sub> (The mean income for
                        males is less than or equal to the mean income for females)</li>
                    <li>Alternative hypothesis (H<sub>A</sub>): &mu;<sub>M</sub> &gt; &mu;<sub>F</sub> (The mean income
                        for males is greater than the mean income for females)</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <h2>Assumptions</h2>
                <p>I made the following assumptions for the t-test:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The incomes for both males and females are normally distributed.</li>
                    <li>The variances of the two populations are equal (homogeneity of variance).</li>
                    <li>The samples are independent.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Conducting the Test</h2>
                <p>Next, I performed an independent two-sample t-test assuming equal variances. Here’s how I did it:</p>

                <h3>1. Calculating Descriptive Statistics</h3>
                <p>
                    I calculated the mean and standard deviation for both male and female incomes using the following
                    Excel formulas:
                <ul>
                    <li>Mean for Males: <code>=AVERAGE(B2:B61)</code></li>
                    <li>Mean for Females: <code>=AVERAGE(B62:B121)</code></li>
                    <li>Standard Deviation for Males: <code>=STDEV.P(B2:B61)</code></li>
                    <li>Standard Deviation for Females: <code>=STDEV.P(B62:B121)</code></li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>2. Using Excel's Data Analysis Toolpak</h3>
                <p>
                    I enabled the Data Analysis Toolpak in Excel and followed these steps:
                <ul>
                    <li>Went to <strong>Data</strong> -> <strong>Data Analysis</strong> -> <strong>t-Test: Two-Sample
                            Assuming Equal Variances</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Selected the ranges for male (<code>B2:B61</code>) and female (<code>B62:B121</code>) income
                        data.</li>
                    <li>Set the hypothesised mean difference to 0.</li>
                    <li>Chose a confidence level of 95%.</li>
                    <li>Selected the output range for the results.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>3. Interpreting the Output</h3>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    Based on the results:
                <ul>
                    <li>The mean income for males is 8.68 units higher than the mean income for females.</li>
                    <li>The t-statistic is 3.27, indicating the number of standard errors that the observed difference
                        in sample means is away from the hypothesised difference in population means.</li>
                    <li>The one-tailed p-value is 0.00071, which is less than the significance level of 0.05.</li>
                    <li>The t-statistic (3.27) is greater than the critical t-value for the one-tailed test (1.66),
                        leading me to reject the null hypothesis.</li>
                </ul>
                Given that I reject the null hypothesis, I conclude that there is significant evidence to suggest that
                the mean income for males is greater than the mean income for females.
                </p>

                <h2>Assumptions Validation</h2>
                <p>
                    To ensure the validity of this test, I would checked the following assumptions:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Normality:</strong> I would use normality tests like the Shapiro-Wilk test or Q-Q plots
                        to
                        check if the impurity distributions are approximately normal.</li>
                    <li><strong>Equality of Variances:</strong> I would use Levene's test or an F-test to assess the
                        homogeneity of variances.</li>
                    <li><strong>Independence:</strong> The samples should be independent of each other.</li>
                </ul>
                By validating these assumptions, I can be confident in the results of my t-test analysis.

                <h2>Summary Measures Worksheet: Exercise 7.3 Two-Tailed Test for Filtration Data</h2>
                <p>
                <p>I conducted an analysis to determine whether the population mean impurity differs between the two
                    filtration agents using the provided data set. Here's the detailed process I followed:</p>

                <h2>Formulating the Hypotheses</h2>
                <p>
                    I started by formulating the hypotheses:
                <ul>
                    <li>Null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>): &mu;<sub>1</sub> = &mu;<sub>2</sub> (The population mean
                        impurity for Agent 1 is equal to that of Agent 2)</li>
                    <li>Alternative hypothesis (H<sub>1</sub>): &mu;<sub>1</sub> ≠ &mu;<sub>2</sub> (The population mean
                        impurity for Agent 1 is not equal to that of Agent 2)</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <h2>Assumptions</h2>
                <p>I made the following assumptions for the t-test:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The impurity measurements for both filtration agents are normally distributed.</li>
                    <li>The variances of the two populations are equal (homogeneity of variance).</li>
                    <li>The samples are independent.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Conducting the Test</h2>
                <p>Next, I performed a two-tailed t-test to compare the population mean impurity between the two
                    filtration agents.</p>

                <h3>1. Calculating Descriptive Statistics</h3>
                <p>
                    I calculated the mean and standard deviation for both filtration agents' impurity measurements using
                    the following Excel formulas:
                <ul>
                    <li>Mean for Agent 1: <code>=AVERAGE(B2:B13)</code></li>
                    <li>Mean for Agent 2: <code>=AVERAGE(C2:C13)</code></li>
                    <li>Standard Deviation for Agent 1: <code>=STDEV.S(B2:B13)</code></li>
                    <li>Standard Deviation for Agent 2: <code>=STDEV.S(C2:C13)</code></li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>2. Performing the t-Test</h3>
                <p>
                    I used Excel's Data Analysis Toolpak to perform the t-test:
                <ul>
                    <li>Enabled the Data Analysis Toolpak in Excel.</li>
                    <li>Went to <strong>Data</strong> -> <strong>Data Analysis</strong> -> <strong>t-Test: Two-Sample
                            Assuming Equal Variances</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Selected the impurity measurements for both filtration agents as input ranges.</li>
                    <li>Set the hypothesised mean difference to 0.</li>
                    <li>Chose a confidence level.</li>
                    <li>Selected the output range for the results.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Based on the results:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The mean impurity for Agent 1 is approximately 0.43 units lower than the mean impurity for Agent
                        2.</li>
                    <li>The t-statistic is approximately -1.03, indicating the number of standard errors that the
                        observed difference in sample means is away from the hypothesied difference in population
                        means.</li>
                    <li>The two-tailed p-value is approximately 0.316, which is greater than the significance level of
                        0.05.</li>
                    <li>The absolute value of the t-statistic (1.03) is less than the critical t-value for the
                        two-tailed test (2.07), leading me to fail to reject the null hypothesis.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Given that I fail to reject the null hypothesis, I conclude that there is insufficient evidence to
                    suggest that the mean impurity differs between the two filtration agents.</p>
                <h2>Assumptions Validation</h2>
                <p>
                    To ensure the validity of this test, I would checked the following assumptions:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Normality:</strong> I would use normality tests like the Shapiro-Wilk test or Q-Q plots
                        to
                        check if the impurity distributions are approximately normal.</li>
                    <li><strong>Equality of Variances:</strong> I would use Levene's test or an F-test to assess the
                        homogeneity of variances.</li>
                    <li><strong>Independence:</strong> The samples should be independent of each other.</li>
                </ul>
                By validating these assumptions, I can be confident in the results of my t-test analysis.

                <h2>Summary Measures Worksheet: Exercise 7.4 One-Tailed Test Comparison</h2>
                <p>For a one-tailed test to determine whether Filter Agent 1 is more effective, I would compare the mean
                    impurity of Agent 1 to that of Agent 2 and focus on the direction of the difference rather than its
                    magnitude.</p>
                <p>Here's how the comparison would go based on the provided data:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mean Impurity for Agent 1: 8.25</li>
                    <li>Mean Impurity for Agent 2: 8.683333333</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Considering the means, it appears that Agent 1 has a lower impurity on average compared to Agent 2.
                    However, I need to confirm if this difference is statistically significant in the context of a
                    one-tailed test.</p>
                <p>Given that the one-tailed t-test focuses on whether one mean is significantly greater or less than
                    the other, I would analyse the t-statistic and p-value from the two-tailed test to infer this.</p>
                <p>From the two-tailed test results:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>t Stat: -1.026865443</li>
                    <li>P(T&lt;=t) two-tail: 0.315642517</li>
                    <li>t Critical two-tail: 2.073873068</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The t-statistic is negative, indicating that Agent 1's mean impurity is lower than Agent 2's mean
                    impurity. However, the p-value is greater than the significance level of 0.05, suggesting that this
                    difference is not statistically significant.</p>
                <p>If I had conducted a one-tailed test focusing on whether Agent 1's impurity is less than Agent 2's, I
                    would use the same t-statistic but halve the p-value from the two-tailed test (since the one-tailed
                    test only looks at one direction of the distribution). If the halved p-value is less than 0.05, I
                    would reject the null hypothesis and conclude that Agent 1 is indeed more effective than Agent 2 in
                    reducing impurity.</p>
                <p>However, since the p-value from the two-tailed test is already greater than 0.05, it's highly
                    unlikely that halving it for the one-tailed test would yield a significant result. Therefore, based
                    on the available data, I would still fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is
                    insufficient evidence to suggest that Agent 1 is more effective than Agent 2 in reducing impurity.

                        Alternative hypothesis (H<sub>1</sub>): &mu;<sub>M</sub> > &mu;<sub>F</sub> (The population
                        mean income for males exceeds that of females).</li>
                    <li><strong>Assumptions:</strong> We assume that the incomes for males and females are normally
                        distributed, the variances of the two populations are equal, and the samples are
                        independent.</li>

                        a statistically significant difference between the mean incomes of males and females. If the
                        p-value is less than the significance level (e.g., 0.05), reject the null hypothesis and
                        conclude that the mean income for males exceeds that of females.</li>
                    <li><strong>Validate Assumptions:</strong> Validate the assumptions of normality, equality of
                        variances, and independence using appropriate statistical tests or graphical methods (e.g.,
