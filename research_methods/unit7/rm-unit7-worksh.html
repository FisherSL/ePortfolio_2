                <h4>Interpretation</h4>
                <p>Null hypothesis:

                    <em>There is no significant difference between the effectivenes of Agent 1 and Agent 2.</em> <br><br>
                    
                    Since the p value for the one tailed test of 0.008 is leass than 0.05 the difference at the 5% level is statistically significant hence the null hypothesis can be rejected i.e. there is strong evidence that Agent 1 produces less impurities than Agent 2 .

                <h2>Summary Measures Worksheet: Exercise 7.2</h2>
                <p>The task was to determine whether the mean income of males and females were significantly different from the data set provide</p>

                <h2></h2>
                <p>Since the calculated F value is less than the critical value, it can be assumed that there is no significant difference between the variances for the two variables. Hence we use a two tailed t test with equal variances to answer the question: "Does the mean income for males exceed that of females?" <br><br>To do this we test a null hypotheis that:<br><br> <em>There is no difference between the population mean income for males and females.</em> <br><br>The results are shown below.
                </p>

                <h3>Interpretation</h3>

                <p>Since the calculated value of t (3.268) is less than the Critical value of t (1.98) we reject the null hypothesis since the probabilty of this difference being purely due to chance is less than 1% (as p=0.001).
                </p>

                <h3>Assumptions</h3
                    >
                <p>We have already assumed there is no significant differences in the variances using the F test and hence the appropriate type of t test chosen.
                </p>
                <p>Since the t test is a parametric test, assumptions here are that the income data is normally distributed. This could be confirmed by plotting the data to produce a distribution curve / histogram and confirmed with another tests such as Shapiro-Wilk (since number of observations is less than 100)
