                <h3>Case study background</h3>
                <p>Abi is a researcher at an institute and also a statistical programmer. Abi has received a project from a manufacturer to review the nutritional value of a new cereal, Whizzz. Having collected the necessary data, he now needs to perform the appropriate analyses and print the reports for him to send to the manufacturer. Unfortunately, the data Abi has collected seems to refute the claim that Whizzz is nutritious, and, in fact, they may indicate that Whizzz is harmful.</p>

                <p>Abi also realises that some other correlations could be performed that would cast Whizzz in a more favourable light. “After all,” he thinks, “I can use statistics to support either side of any issue.”</p>
                    
                <p><strong>Ethical Concerns</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Clearly, if Abi changed data values in this study he would be acting unethically. But is it any more ethical for him to suggest analysing correct data in a way that supports two or more different conclusions?</li>
                        <li>Is Abi obligated to present both the positive and the negative analyses?</li>
                        <li>Is Abi responsible for the use to which others put his program results?</li>
                        <li>If Abi does put forward both sets of results to the manufacturer, he suspects that they will publicise only the positive ones. What other courses of action has he?</li>
                    </ul>
                                        
                    You should also highlight legal, social and professional impacts of any choices made. Please note that there are no right or wrong answers here and you may introduce local, as well as international, legislature in your responses.</p>

                <h3>Initial Post</h3>

                <p>In this scenario, the fact that Abi is suggesting different ways to analyse the data is not only ethical but is a requirement as the duty to ‘do not harm and ‘avoid bias’ in his work is enshrined in many codes of ethics / conduct e.g.  Royal Statistical Society (2019); British Computer Society (BCS) (2022). Furthermore, Abi should present all possible analyses of the data, ensuring full transparency of his methods, assumptions, sources of error, confidence limits and any limitations of the statistical methods used.</p>
                <p>Whilst Abi has no control over how his results are used by the manufacturer of the cereal, provided his report adheres to ethical requirements, this would be his defence in any possible enforcement action sought against him for misuse of his analysis.</p>

                <p>If Abi identifies possible misuse of his analysis, he has several options in the UK depending on the manner of misuse.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Advertisement - Inform the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). </li>
                        <li>Food packaging – Inform the Food Standards Agency (FSA) or Trading Standards. </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>As far as the manufacturer is concerned, they run the risk of being prosecuted under EU Regulation 1924/2006 which with amendments has been retained in UK law as the <em>Nutrition and Health Claims Regulations 2007</em>.</p>
