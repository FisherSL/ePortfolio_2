                <h2>Research Proposal Review</h2>
                <h3></h3>
                <p>After feedback from prospective supervisors (not included here for privacy reasons), I have decided to proceed with testing the efficiency of encryption algorithms under the MQTT protocol in IoT devices.</p>
                <p>The type of research design I will be undertaking is conclusive, since my aim is to determine which algorithm(s) are the most efficient.</p>
                <p>We were asked to conside three questions:</p>

                <h3>Which research methods would suit my purpose?</h3>
                <p>The test software will produce and record data which can then be analysed to calculate and compare the efficiencies of each algorithm. The measure of efficiency is yet to be determined but initial thoughts are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>memory usage</li>
                    <li>encryption/decryption time (as a measure of processor power required)</li>
                    <li>energy usage (this would require a simulation with a physical aspect so that energy usage could be measured)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Which data collection methods will I consider using?</h3>
                <p>Since the data I will be producing is numerical, I will be using quantitative research methods by experiment. I will write the simulation code or use a prewritten simulator to produce data which can be analysed to determine a comparison of efficiency. In addition, according to (Dawson, 2015) my study will be ‘causal’ since I will be investigating the effect of changing the encryption algorithm (independent variable) on the efficiency (dependent variable).</p>

                <h3>What skills will I need to have or develop for the chosen project?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>General Python programming.</li>
                    <li>Implementing encryption algorithms in Python using relevant libraries if appropriate.</li>
                    <li>Technical knowledge of how MQTT protocol works.</li>
                    <li>How to implement MQTT in Python.</li>
                    <li>How to control any other factors which may affect those being measured i.e. control variables.</li>
                    <li>Relevant statistical tests.</li>
                    <li>Literature research skills</li>
                </ul>
