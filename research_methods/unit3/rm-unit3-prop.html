                <h2>e-Portfolio Activity: Research Proposal Review</h2>
                <h3>Considering My Project: "Unveiling Digital Cults: The Influence of AI and Social Media on Mass
                    Movements"</h3>
                <p>For my project on the influence of AI and social media on mass movements, I have carefully selected
                    research methods and data collection techniques that align with my objectives and the complexity of
                    the topic.</p>

                <h2>Which Methods Would Suit My Purpose?</h2>
                <p>From Dawson (2015), I found that certain research methods align well with my project goals:</p>

                <h3>Exploratory Studies</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> Since my project involves exploring the relatively new and complex
                        phenomenon of digital cults, an exploratory study is most appropriate. This method will help me
                        understand what is happening, seek new insights, and assess phenomena from a fresh perspective.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Application:</strong> I will start with literature searches to gather existing knowledge
                        on digital cults, AI, and social media. Following this, I plan to use open-ended questionnaires
                        and conduct interviews to gather qualitative data from individuals involved in or affected by
                        digital cults.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Descriptive Studies</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> Descriptive studies will allow me to review and evaluate existing
                        theories and knowledge, as well as describe the characteristics of digital cults and the role of
                        AI and social media in their formation and growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Application:</strong> I will use case studies to describe specific instances of digital
                        cults, detailing their development, the influence of AI algorithms, and social media dynamics.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Which Data Collection Methods Would I Consider Using?</h2>
                <p>Based on Dawson (2015) and other readings, I will use the following data collection methods:</p>

                <h3>Surveys</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> Surveys are effective for collecting a large amount of data from a
                        sizable population in an economical way. They will help me understand the broader impact of
                        digital cults.</li>
                    <li><strong>Application:</strong> I plan to distribute online surveys to gather data on public
                        perceptions and experiences with digital cults and the influence of AI and social media on these
                        movements.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Interviews</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> Interviews provide in-depth qualitative insights and allow for a
                        deeper understanding of individual experiences and expert opinions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Application:</strong> I will conduct semi-structured interviews with experts in AI,
                        social media analysts, and former members of digital cults to gather detailed qualitative data.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Case Studies</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> Case studies allow for an in-depth exploration of specific digital
                        cults to understand their formation, dynamics, and impact.</li>
                    <li><strong>Application:</strong> I will perform case studies on well-documented digital cults,
                        using a combination of interviews, social media analysis, and document reviews to provide a
                        comprehensive understanding.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Content Analysis</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> Content analysis is useful for analysing the content and
                        communication patterns within digital cults.</li>
                    <li><strong>Application:</strong> I will utilise tools for content analysis to examine social media
                        posts, focusing on language patterns, key themes, and the spread of information within these
                        groups.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Which Required Skills Will I Need to Have or Develop for the Chosen Project?</h2>
                <p>Based on the readings, I will need to develop several key skills:</p>

                <h3>Literature Review Skills</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Application:</strong> I need to be able to search, review, and synthesise existing
                        literature on digital cults, AI, and social media.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Survey Design and Analysis</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Application:</strong> I will craft effective survey questions, distribute surveys
                        online, and analyse the results using statistical software.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Interviewing Skills</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Application:</strong> I will need to conduct both structured and unstructured
                        interviews, develop questions, practice active listening, and perform qualitative data analysis.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Data Analysis Skills</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Application:</strong> I will analyse qualitative data from interviews and case studies,
                        as well as quantitative data from surveys. This includes familiarity with tools like NVivo for
                        qualitative data analysis and statistical software for quantitative analysis.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Content Analysis Skills</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Application:</strong> I will use content analysis software to analyse large datasets
                        from social media and understand natural language processing (NLP) techniques to assess the
                        content of social media posts and other digital communications.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Critical Thinking and Analytical Skills</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Application:</strong> I will need to evaluate and interpret data critically to draw
                        meaningful conclusions and ensure the reliability and validity of my findings.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>By combining these methods and data collection techniques, I am confident that I will be able to
                    comprehensively explore the influence of AI and social media on mass movements and provide valuable
                    insights.</p>
