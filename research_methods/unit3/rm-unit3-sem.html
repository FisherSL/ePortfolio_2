                <h2>Familiarisation with Purpose, Problem, Objective, or Research Question</h2>
                <h3>Paper 1: Cyber Security Awareness Among University Students</h3>
                <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To measure the level of cybersecurity awareness among university students.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> The increasing use of digital devices and the Internet has heightened
                    cybersecurity vulnerabilities, making it essential for university students to be aware of these
                    risks.</p>
                <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To evaluate students' knowledge of cybersecurity and recommend measures
                    to improve awareness.</p>
                <p><strong>Research Questions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How much do students know about information security?</li>
                    <li>What can be done to ensure students remain safe in online communities?</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Contribution to Knowledge:</strong> Provides insights into the cybersecurity awareness levels
                    of university students and highlights the need for educational interventions.</p>
                <h3>Paper 2: Cyber Risk and Cybersecurity: A Systematic Review of Data Availability</h3>
                <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To systematically review the availability of data related to cyber risks
                    and cybersecurity.</p>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> The continuous development of cyber risks and the need for robust
                    countermeasures require comprehensive data availability for effective analysis.</p>
                <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To assess the current state of data availability for cybersecurity
                    research.</p>
                <p><strong>Methodology:</strong> Systematic review based on the PRISMA framework, focusing on
                    peer-reviewed articles published in the last 10 years that use cybersecurity or cyber risk datasets.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Contribution to Knowledge:</strong> Offers a detailed overview of existing datasets in the
                    field of cybersecurity, aiding future research by highlighting gaps and available resources.</p>
                <h2>Data Collection and Analysis</h2>
                <h3>Paper 1: Cyber Security Awareness Among University Students</h3>
                <p><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Questionnaire administered to university students.</p>
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Statistical analysis of questionnaire responses to determine awareness
                    levels.</p>
                <p><strong>Appropriateness:</strong> The use of questionnaires and statistical analysis is appropriate
                    for quantitatively assessing awareness levels.</p>
                <p><strong>Justification:</strong> These methods allow for objective measurement and analysis of
                    students' cybersecurity awareness.</p>
                <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Potential biases may exist in questionnaire responses, such as social
                    desirability bias. Additionally, the study's findings may be limited to the specific university
                    context.</p>

                <h3>Paper 2: Cyber Risk and Cybersecurity: A Systematic Review of Data Availability</h3>
                <p><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Literature search across multiple databases (IEEE Xplore, Scopus,
                    SpringerLink, Web of Science).</p>
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Systematic review of articles using the PRISMA framework.</p>
                <p><strong>Appropriateness:</strong> The comprehensive search and systematic review process ensure a
                    thorough examination of available data.</p>
                <p><strong>Justification:</strong> This method is effective for identifying and summarising the state of
                    data availability in cybersecurity research.</p>
                <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Limitations may include publication bias, as only peer-reviewed
                    articles were included, and the possibility of missing relevant articles despite comprehensive
                    search strategies.</p>

                <h2>Suggestions for Paper Improvements</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Clearer Research Questions:</strong> While the research questions provided are good,
                            they could be more specific to guide the research process more effectively. For example,
                            adding details such as "What specific cyber threats are university students most aware of?"
                            and "What educational interventions have proven effective in enhancing cybersecurity
                            awareness among university students?" can add depth to the inquiry.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Clarity in Methodology Description:</strong> In Paper 2, it's mentioned that the
                            methodology is based on the PRISMA framework, which is great for systematic reviews.
                            However, it might be helpful to briefly explain what the PRISMA framework entails for
                            readers who may not be familiar with it. This could provide context and transparency
                            regarding the systematic review process.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Expansion of Data Collection Details:</strong> While both papers briefly mention
                            their data collection methods, providing more detail on the questionnaire used in Paper 1
                            and the criteria for article selection in Paper 2 would enhance transparency and
                            reproducibility.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Discussion of Limitations:</strong> Including a brief discussion of the limitations
                            of each study would add depth to the papers. For example, potential biases in questionnaire
                            responses in Paper 1 or limitations in the search strategy in Paper 2 could be acknowledged
                            and discussed.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Visual Aids:</strong> Consider incorporating visual aids such as charts, graphs, or
                            tables to illustrate key findings, particularly in the Data Collection and Analysis
                            sections. Visual representations can enhance understanding and engagement with the material.
