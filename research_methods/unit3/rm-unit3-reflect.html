                <h2>Reflecting on Unit 3</h2>

                <section>
                    <p>Unit 3 provided an in-depth exploration into methodology, offering insights into the fundamental
                        aspects of research design and methods. This unit served as a foundation for understanding the
                        underlying assumptions, research designs, and various research methods essential for conducting
                        meaningful research.</p>
                    <p>One critical aspect explored in Unit 3 was the importance of research design in guiding the
                        research process and aligning with research objectives. Distinguishing between exploratory and
                        descriptive research designs provided clarity on approaching different research problems
                        effectively.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, the unit introduced three main research methods: qualitative, quantitative, and mixed
                        methods research. Understanding the characteristics, tools, and techniques associated with each
                        method equipped us with the necessary knowledge to make informed decisions about which method
                        best suits our research objectives.</p>

                    <h2>Summary of Activities</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Lecturecast:</strong> Engaged in solo self-study to comprehend the concepts of
                            research design and methods. Utilised this time to deepen understanding and reflect on the
                            applicability of different research methods.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Reading:</strong> Independently explored the foundational aspects of research design
                            and methodology, gaining insights into the underlying assumptions and implications for
                            research practice.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Peer Review Seminar:</strong> Participated in a collaborative peer review seminar,
                            analysing research papers utilising different research methods. This interactive session
                            provided valuable insights and perspectives from peers, enriching the learning experience.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Unit 3 has equipped me with essential knowledge and skills required for navigating the
                        intricacies of research methodology effectively.</p>
                    <h2>So what?</h2>
                    <p>The most significant aspect of Unit 3's tasks was the opportunity for both independent
                        exploration and collaborative engagement. Engaging in solo self-study allowed me to deepen my
                        understanding of research methodology concepts, while the peer review seminar facilitated
                        interactive learning and knowledge exchange with course mates.</p>
                    <p>This unit underscored the significance of research design and methodology in shaping the research
                        process. By critically analysing research papers utilising different methods, I gained practical
                        insights into the application of research methods in real-world scenarios.</p>
                    <h2>What next?</h2>
                    <p>From these experiences, I have learned the importance of balancing independent exploration with
                        collaborative engagement in the learning process. Moving forward, I aim to continue leveraging
                        self-study opportunities to deepen my understanding of research methodology concepts.
                        Additionally, I will actively seek opportunities for collaborative learning, such as peer review
                        seminars, to enhance my analytical and critical thinking skills.</p>
