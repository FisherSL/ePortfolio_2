                    <h3>What Was Unit 3 About?</h3>
                    <p>Unit 1 of the Research Methods module serves as an introduction to the fundamental concepts and
                        principles underpinning research practice. Here's a summary of what Unit 1 entails:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Purpose of Research:</strong> The module begins by addressing the fundamental
                            question of why research is conducted. It explores three primary purposes of research:
                            exploration, description, and explanation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Scientific Method and Types of Reasoning:</strong> A significant focus is placed on
                            the scientific method, which involves observation, hypothesis formulation, reasoning, and
                            testing. Additionally, the module delves into two core types of reasoning: deductive and
                            inductive reasoning.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ethical Considerations in Research:</strong> The importance of research ethics is
                            emphasised, highlighting key principles such as respect, beneficence, justice, and adherence
                            to legal and public interest standards. The module stresses the need for ethical approval in
                            research involving human participants and sensitive data.</li>
                        <li><strong>Professionalism and Professional Practice:</strong> Alongside ethical
                            considerations, the module emphasises the significance of professionalism in research and
                            practice. It provides insights into professionalism in various fields of Computer Science,
                            including data protection and intellectual property rights.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Overall, Unit 1 aims to equip students with a foundational understanding of research methods,
                        ethical principles, and professionalism in research practice. Upon completion of the unit,
                        students are expected to differentiate between inductive and deductive reasoning and understand
                        the importance of ethics in research and professional practice.</p>
                    </p>
                    <h3>What happened?</h3>
                    <p>Unit 1 of our Research Methods module provided a solid foundation in research practices and
                        ethical considerations. Throughout the unit, I engaged in both individual exploration and
                        collaborative learning experiences with my peers.</p>
                    <p>During our studies, we explored various research methodologies and ethical frameworks. However,
                        it wasn't just about solitary learning. We also had the opportunity to work together as a group,
                        exchanging ideas.</p>
                    <p>Some of the collaborative activities we participated in included:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Group Discussions:</strong> These activities allowed us to analyse case studies and
                            real-world research scenarios together, offering diverse perspectives and enhancing our
                            critical thinking skills.</li>
                        <li><strong>Peer Feedback:</strong> Giving and receiving feedback from classmates on our
                            discussion posts helped us refine our ideas and develop stronger research plans,
                            demonstrating the value of peer support and constructive criticism.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Through these collaborative experiences, I gained a deeper appreciation for the importance of
                        teamwork and peer learning in research endeavors. Together, we explored complex topics,
                        navigated ethical dilemmas, and ultimately grew as researchers.</p>

                    <h3>So what? (Interpretation – now you analyse)</h3>
                    <h4>Interpretation of Experience</h4>
                    <p><strong>Experience:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Most Important Aspect:</strong> Collaboration and conversation during group
                            activities.</li>
                        <li><strong>Relevance:</strong> Starting to contemplate the ethics of data and research.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                    <p>The collaborative nature of the learning experience, characterised by group discussions and
                        project work, can be attributed to research findings that cooperative learning experiences
                        encourage higher achievement (Maughan, 2001). This collaborative approach fosters critical
                        thinking, promotes
                        knowledge sharing, and enhances problem-solving skills.</p>
                    <p><strong>Comparison:</strong></p>
                    <p>This collaborative learning approach is similar to previous modules but remains integral to the
                        learning process in every course. The consistency in incorporating collaborative activities
                        across modules provides continuity in learning and allows for the reinforcement of key concepts
                        and skills.</p>
                    <h3>What Next?</h3>
                    <h4>Reflection on Learning</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Learned:</strong> How to academically communicate with fellow classmates about
                            important issues in a conducive environment.</li>
                        <li><strong>Plan for Next Time:</strong> Dive deeper into topics related to personal interests
                            and utilise the methods learned for own research aims.</li>
                        <li><strong>Areas for Further Exploration:</strong> Efficient time management for collaborative
                            discussions and seminars outside of work hours.</li>
                        <li><strong>Application in Future:</strong> Valuable skills acquired, such as effective
                            communication, critical thinking, and fact-based argumentation, applicable in both academic
                            and professional life.</li>
                    </ul>
