                    <p>Completing the research proposal review was a very useful exercise as it got me thinking in more detail about my possible capstone project. Specifically, it prompted me to do some more reading around the subject to begin to formulate the kind of testing environment I would need to collect meaningful data.</p>

                    <p>Initially, I had assumed that I would test the efficiency of the encryption algorithms in a simulated, virtual environment coded in python, however, a paper by Gupta, et al, (2020) physically simulated a home security system using various, readily available modules and sensors. This has raised the possibility of doing something similar i.e. creating a physical, rather than virtual testing system. At present I do not have the knowledge and skills to achieve this, but the idea intrigues me.</p>

                    <p>Going forward I intend to do some more research to ascertain if using a physical testing environment would be advantageous / desirable.</p>
