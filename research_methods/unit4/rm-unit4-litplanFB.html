                <h2>Lit Review Plan</h2>
                <p> If you want to be reminded of my Lit review plan, It can be found in Unit 2, or click on the button
                    below.</p>
                <a href="../../research_methods\unit2\rm-unit2-litplan.html" class="back-button">▶ Go to this page!</a>
                <p>In this section I will go over the lit review plan, how I feel about the subject and areas of my life
                    where this has been significantly important.</p>
                <h3>The Feedback & Changes to Make</h3>
                <p><strong>Feedback</strong></p>
                <p>My literature review was initially titled "Cloud Security Risks in Call Tracking and CRM in MarTech".
                    The feedback I received suggested that it would be beneficial to incorporate a keyword such as "to
                    understand," "to identify," "to assess," or "to experiment" at the beginning of the research title
                    to clarify the research focus. This constructive feedback was incredibly valuable, and as a result,
                    I revised the title to <strong>"INVESTIGATING CLOUD SECURITY RISKS WITHIN MARTECH (EU
                        CONTEXT)"</strong>. This new title more accurately reflects the investigative nature of my
                    research and aligns with the suggested improvements.</p>
                <p>Receiving positive feedback on my first-ever literature review was encouraging. It reassured me that
                    I am on the right track and provided me with the confidence to move forward. I believe that
                    submitting a detailed plan in Unit 4 will be instrumental in refining my research approach and will
                    contribute significantly to the quality of my final submission in Unit 7. The feedback process has
                    highlighted the importance of clarity and focus in academic writing, which I will continue to
                    prioritise in my future work.</p>
                <h3>The Topic & Impact on my Life</h3>
                <p><strong>Topic & Recent Life Events</strong>
                <p>In recent life events, I am excited to share that I
                    recently interviewed for and was offered a job at a prominent MarTech company. This new role is
                    particularly significant as it aligns closely with my academic interests and research on cloud
                    security risks within MarTech. I am thrilled about this opportunity as I believe it will provide me
                    with invaluable practical experience and insights.</p>
                <p>Starting as a product owner, I will be managing a team responsible for developing the CRM platform.
                    This role involves significant responsibilities, including overseeing the integration of secure
                    cloud technologies, which directly relates to my literature review topic. This hands-on experience
                    will not only deepen my understanding of the practical challenges and solutions in cloud security
                    but will also enrich my academic research with real-world perspectives.</p>
                <p>This job offer has given me a sense of accomplishment and motivation. The skills and knowledge I gain
                    in this role will undoubtedly enhance my academic endeavors. I am looking forward to applying
                    theoretical concepts to practical scenarios, which I believe will bridge the gap between my studies
                    and professional development. This opportunity will serve as a solid foundation for my future career
                    in MarTech, providing me with a robust understanding of both the technological and managerial
                    aspects of the field.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, the positive feedback on my literature review and the new job opportunity are pivotal
                    moments in my academic and professional journey. Both experiences are interlinked and will mutually
                    reinforce each other, contributing to my growth and success in the field of MarTech.</p>
