                <h2>The Case</h2>
                <p><em>Ricardo works for the records department of his local government as a computer records clerk,
                        where he has access to files of property tax records. For a scientific study, a researcher,
                        Beth, has been granted access to the numerical portion “but not the corresponding names” of
                        some records.
                        Beth finds some information that she would like to use, but she needs the names and
                        addresses corresponding with certain properties. Beth asks Ricardo to retrieve these names
                        and addresses, so she can contact these people for more information and for permission to do
                        further study.
                        Now consider, what are the ethical issues involved in deciding which of these options to
                        pursue?
                        <li> If Ricardo is not responsible for determining allowable access, should he release the
                            names and addresses? </li>
                        <li> Suppose Ricardo were responsible for determining allowable access to the files. What
                            ethical issues would be involved in his deciding whether to grant access to Beth?</li>
                        <li> Should Beth be allowed to contact the individuals involved? That is, should the Records
                            department release individuals' names to a researcher? What are the ethical issues for the
                            Records department to consider?</li>
                        <li> Suppose Beth contacts the individuals to ask their permission, and one-third of them
                            respond giving permission, one-third respond denying permission, and one-third do not
                            respond. Beth claims that at least one-half of the individuals are needed to make a valid
                            study. What options are available to Beth?</li><br>

                <h3>My Response</h3>
                <p><strong>Ricardo's Responsibility:</strong> Ricardo's role as a records clerk grants him access to
                    sensitive information, raising concerns about confidentiality and data protection. Even if
                    Ricardo is not responsible for determining access, he still holds a duty to safeguard
                    individuals' privacy rights and ensure compliance with organisational policies and regulations
                    regarding data access and sharing.</p>
                <p><strong>Granting Access:</strong> If Ricardo were responsible for determining access, ethical
                    considerations would revolve around balancing the researcher's need for information with the
                    potential risks to individuals' privacy. He would need to assess the researcher's intentions,
                    the necessity of the requested data, and the potential impact on individuals' rights and
                    well-being before deciding. Moreover, Ricardo would need to consider the implications of
                    cross-border privacy laws, as data protection regulations may vary across different regions,
                    complicating the decision-making process further.</p>
                <p><strong>Contacting Individuals:</strong> Releasing individuals' names to a researcher raises
                    ethical concerns about informed consent and potential harm. The Records department must weigh
                    the researcher's objectives against individuals' rights to privacy and autonomy. Any contact
                    with individuals should be conducted ethically, ensuring that they are fully informed about the
                    purpose of the study and could consent or decline participation without coercion.</p>
                <p><strong>Validity of Beth's Study:</strong> Beth's study validity hinges on obtaining sufficient
                    participant consent. However, her reliance on a specific response rate for validity raises
                    ethical questions about the threshold for informed consent and the ethical conduct of research.
                    Beth should explore alternative methods for obtaining consent or consider revising her study
                    design to ensure ethical integrity and participant well-being.</p>
