                <h2>The Case</h2>
                <p><em>Ricardo works for the records department of his local government as a computer records clerk,
                        where he has access to files of property tax records. For a scientific study, a researcher,
                        Beth, has been granted access to the numerical portion “but not the corresponding names” of
                        some records.
                        Beth finds some information that she would like to use, but she needs the names and
                        addresses corresponding with certain properties. Beth asks Ricardo to retrieve these names
                        and addresses, so she can contact these people for more information and for permission to do
                        further study.
                        Now consider, what are the ethical issues involved in deciding which of these options to
                        pursue?</em>
                        </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Questions to consider:</h3>
                <p><em>1. If Ricardo is not responsible for determining allowable access, should he release the names and addresses?</em></p>
                <h4>Response:</h4>
                <p>Since Ricardo only has authority to allow Beth access to the numerical portion of the database, he should not release names and addresses. Beth must obtain permission from someone who has the authority to grant it (if granting that permission is allowable under the Data Protection Act 2018 and UK GDPR regulations. The UK GDPR regulations do state that:</p>

                <cite>“…scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes (‘purpose limitation’)”</cite> (ICO, N.D.a)

                <p><em>2. Suppose Ricardo were responsible for determining allowable access to the files. What ethical issues would be involved in his deciding whether to grant access to Beth?</em></p>

                <h4>Response:</h4>

                <p>Beth would be required to make an application to access this data following the guidelines provided by her supervisory body. This will specify how Beth intends to adhere to the key principles of data protection:
                    <ul>
                        <li>used fairly, lawfully and transparently</li>
                        <li>collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes</li>
                        <li>adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes</li>
                        <li>accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date</li>
                        <li>kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes</li>
                        <li>kept secure with appropriate technical and organisational measures</li>
                    </ul>
                    Ricardo, as the data controller must then only grant access if he believes Beth’s request is lawful under data protection legislation and appropriate safeguards are in place.
                </p>
                <p><em>3. Should Beth be allowed to contact the individuals involved? That is, should the Records department release individuals' names to a researcher? What are the ethical issues for the Records department to consider?</em></p>

                <h4>Response:</h4>

                <p>Under the scientific research provisions of the legislation, Beth is allowed access to contact details to enable her to obtain permission to use people’s data for her purpose (ICO, N.D.a). The records department must be certain that the process of contacting them will not cause ‘substantial harm or distress’. This threshold could be different for different groups of people e.g. those with certain medical conditions or in a certain demographic.
                </p>

                <p><em>4. Suppose Beth contacts the individuals to ask their permission, and one-third of them respond giving permission, one-third respond denying permission, and one-third do not respond. Beth claims that at least one-half of the individuals are needed to make a valid study. What options are available to Beth?</em></p>

                <h4>Response:</h4>

                <p>Since consent must be genuine and informed, Beth can only use data from individuals who have provided this (ICO, N.D.b).
                Whilst she must be careful about not spamming individuals, I see no reason why a single follow up email could not be sent as a polite reminder to those individuals who have not responded.
                </p>
                <p>If Beth is still below the threshold of data for her study, she could:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Proceed with the study with the data she has been given permission to use. This may require that she must adjust the statistical tests she applies to take account of the smaller sample size.</li>
                        <li>Adjust her study in such a way as anonymised data will be acceptable for it.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
