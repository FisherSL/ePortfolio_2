                    <p>I found the learning this week quite straightforward. I have been exposed to data collection methods throughout my academic and professional career, so I am comfortable with them. It seems clear to me that I will be producing and analysing quantitative data in my capstone.</p>
                    <p>Most of my time this week was taken up in putting together the plan for my literature review which I found a challenge. I am still struggling to understand what is precisely expected in ‘critical’ writing. Suggestions have been made that it entails bringing in opposing points of view which is all very well if you can find them! Specific to the literature review, as I understand it, it is exactly that, a review of the state of the subject at the present time and how that state was reached (if appropriate). It can be structured either chronologically (rare) or in themes, starts broad and becomes narrower.</p>
