                <h2>Reflecting on Unit 4</h2>
                </header>
                <section>
                    <p>Unit 4 explored various data collection methods commonly used in qualitative research, offering
                        insights into case studies, focus groups, and observations. These methods play a vital role in
                        gathering detailed data for research purposes, contributing to a deeper understanding of
                        phenomena under study.</p>
                    <p>Case studies involve thorough research and analysis of individuals or groups, providing valuable
                        insights and hypotheses to expand the scope of study. However, it's important to acknowledge
                        their limitations in determining cause and effect and potential for biased interpretations.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, focus groups serve as a prominent qualitative research method, allowing a selected
                        group to express insights on the topic under investigation. Ensuring participants' homogeneity
                        and facilitating open discussions are vital for generating meaningful data.</p>
                    <p>Quantitative and qualitative observations offer distinct approaches to data collection, with the
                        former focusing on numerical values and statistical analysis and the latter on monitoring
                        characteristics in natural settings. Understanding the nuances of each observation method
                        enhances the researcher's ability to collect relevant and reliable data.</p>
                    <h2>Key Takeaways:</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Data Collection Methods:</strong> Understanding the principles and applications of
                            case studies, focus groups, and observations in qualitative research.</li>
                        <li><strong>Advantages and Drawbacks:</strong> Recognising the strengths and limitations of each
                            data collection method and their implications for research design.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Interpretation:</strong> Considering the types of data obtained through
                            different methods and their relevance to research objectives.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h2>Summary of Activities</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Reading:</strong> Engaged in solo reading to explore the fundamentals of case
                            studies, focus groups, and observation methods. This independent study provided insights
                            into the advantages, drawbacks, and applications of each method.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Literature Review Outline:</strong> Drafted a literature review outline for
                            formative feedback, gaining valuable insights and guidance for future submissions. This
                            formative feedback process boosted confidence and provided clarity on expectations,
                            fostering continuous improvement in academic writing.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Seminar:</strong> Participated in a case study seminar on privacy, contributing
                            personal views and insights on ethical considerations. While unable to attend the live
                            seminar, engaging with the recorded session facilitated reflection and consolidation of
                            thoughts on ethical issues in research. However, the submission of work beforehand for
                            feedback could enhance the effectiveness of seminar discussions.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Unit 4 has equipped me with practical knowledge and skills essential for conducting qualitative
                        research and navigating ethical considerations in data collection.</p>
                    <h2>So what?</h2>
                    <p>The most significant aspect of Unit 4's tasks was the opportunity for both independent learning
                        and collaborative engagement. Engaging in solo reading and drafting a literature review outline
                        provided a foundation for understanding data collection methods, while the case study seminar
                        facilitated critical reflection and discussion on ethical issues.</p>
                    <p>This unit underscored the importance of formative feedback in academic development, enhancing
                        confidence and clarity in research writing. Additionally, it highlighted the significance of
                        pre-submission feedback in optimising seminar discussions and maximising learning outcomes.</p>
                    <h2>What next?</h2>
                    <p>From these experiences, I have learned the value of continuous improvement and reflective
                        practice in academic learning. Moving forward, I aim to incorporate feedback received into
                        future submissions, refining my research writing skills and enhancing the quality of academic
                        work. Additionally, I will explore opportunities to engage more actively in seminar discussions
                        and seek pre-submission feedback to maximise learning and development.</p>
