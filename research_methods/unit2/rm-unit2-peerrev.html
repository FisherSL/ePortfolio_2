                <h2>Unit 3 Seminar Preparation</h2>
                <p>Unit 3 Seminar
                    Title: Peer Review Activity
                    In this seminar, we will be focusing on LO 3: “Evaluate critically existing literature, research
                    design and methodology for the chosen topic.” One way this is done is by conducting a peer review of
                    existing literature on a particular subject.
                <p>
                    In preparation for this week’s seminar, you will need to source at least 2 papers in a Computing
                    subject of your choice (AI, Cybersecurity, Data Science, or a general interest topic in Computer
                    Science) provided they utilise two different types of research methods to achieve their
                    goal/research aims. Now answer the following questions (please provide justifications for your
                    answers) and be prepared to discuss them in the session:</p>

                <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Familiarise yourself with the purpose, problem, objective or research question of each paper.
                        Are
                        they in line with your experience or thoughts on the topic, contributing to the collective body
                        of
                        knowledge in this area?</li>
                    <li>Is the research methodology utilised in each paper appropriate for the stated purpose or
                        question?</li>
                    <li>In terms of data collection and analysis, is this also appropriate for the stated purpose or
                        question? (We will discuss this further in upcoming units.)</li>
                    <li>Does each paper support its claims and conclusions with explicit arguments or evidence?
                        How would you enhance the work/paper?</li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <p>You can set up your responses as a presentation for the group. Remember to record your answers and
                    feedback in your e-portfolio.</p>
