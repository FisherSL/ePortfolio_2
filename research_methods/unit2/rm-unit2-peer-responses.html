                <h3>Discussion 1: My responses to initial posts by peers.</h3>

                <p>Since posts in the discussion forum are not available to the public, for privacy reasons I have redacted names and have not provided a copy of the original posts to which I have responded.</p>

                <p><strong>Response 1</strong><br><br>

                    Your post clearly sets out which parts of the BCS code of conduct you feel have been violated and I found your mapping of the ACM code to the BCS useful in comparing the focus of each. 
                
                </p>

                <p>You say that Rogue Services were in breach of several UK laws. I would have found it interesting to know precisely which laws you feel they have broken, with your justifications, since Rogue Services were not UK based.</p>

                <p>I agree that more international cooperation is necessary on cybersecurity matters and found the citation provided an excellent resource. I wonder if you are aware that Budapest Convention on Cybercrime attempts to put in place a framework for international cooperation on cybercrime. For an introduction to the convention see Wilkinson (2023) with full detail available from Council of Europe (N.D.).</p>

                <p>I was interested to find out more regarding the ethical and legal grey area you refer to in this case, so I looked at the citation provided; Levite & Perkovich (2017). Unfortunately, this is a 380-page edited collection of 14 articles hence I was unable to find the information I was looking for. It’s important to note that the referencing system used by the University of Essex Online provides a method to address this kind of issue by requiring that the author of the article where you found the information be included along with the title, chapter, and page range (University of Essex Online, 2024).</p>

                <p>Regarding referencing, I also identified several other issues applying the required style such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reference list should be in alphabetical order.</li>
                        <li>No bullets required in a reference list.</li>
                        <li>Source with more than six authors should be shortened in the reference list as well as in the in-text citation.</li>
                        <li>Any reference accessed online should contain an access date.</li>
                        <li>The correct syntax for using full stops in the reference list.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have found the study skills chat bot an excellent resource for quickly looking up how to cite and reference a particular type of source. I hope you find my comments useful, and I should now go and double check that <em>my</em> application of the referencing style is correct!!
                </p>

                <p><strong>Response 2</strong><br><br>
                    I thought your introductory paragraph set the scene well in respect of the importance of ethical behaviour in business. Whilst voluntary codes of conduct can have a role to play, a study by McNamara et al. (2019) showed that exposing software developers to the ACM code of conduct had no effect on their decision making; hence your comment on the need for enforcement mechanisms is well founded. 
                </p>
                <p>I would be interested in your thoughts regarding the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Do you think that Stewart’s company could also be held in violation of parts 2(d) & (f) of the code?</li>
                        <li>Would the company who instructed the changes to their website be liable for prosecution for fraud if the website’s users made complaints to law enforcement? Would Stewart’s company have any legal liability in these circumstances?</li>
                        <li>•	In the absence of any legal liabilities, would a fraud case against their clients have any other possible repercussions for Stewart’s company?</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p><strong>Response 3</strong><br><br>
                    Thanks for your post regarding medical device implant vulnerabilities. This is an example of a classic Man in the Middle (MitM) attack where a threat actor sits between two communicating parts of a network and either modifies, deletes or fabricates data being sent between them without the knowledge or detection of said parties; see NIST (N.D.) for more detail. </p>

                <p>Cybersecurity of these types of devices are a major concern. Indeed, there have been several recalls and emergency patching of devices including insulin pumps (CISA, 2018), defibrillators (Arghire, 2019) and pacemakers (Hern, 2017). </p>

                <p>The good news is that my research did not produce any real world malicious medical implant hacking events and all successful attacks so far have been made by security researchers. However, such is the potential for serious effects on public health that various regulatory bodies have published guidance on this very issue such as the United States (U.S. Food & Drug Administration, 2023), European Union (EU, 2017) and Canada (Government of Canada, 2019) among others. In addition, the International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF) have also published a document aimed at harmonising guidance around the world (IMDRF, 2020).</p>
