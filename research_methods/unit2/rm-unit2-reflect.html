                    <p><strong>Literature Review Planning</strong><br><br>
                    
                        Despite the lecturecast and reading I struggled to ascertain exactly what was required. Generic grading criteria are also of no use although grading criteria specific to a summative would be. Wider research, whilst it had its merits, seemed to never really get to the crux of the issue by modelling the process with examples. The university also seems very reluctant to provide examples of different standards of literature reviews because of, what appears to me, to be almost a paranoia about potential plagiarism. Whilst I acknowledge that plagiarism is a concern, I would have greatly appreciated access to some literature reviews of differing standards as this would have helped build my confidence that I was ‘on the right track’.

                    <p><strong>Collaborative Discussion 1: Responding to Peers</strong><br><br>
                    
                        I responded to three initial posts which I found most interesting and provided an opportunity to ask questions of the authors which would either prompt them to look deeper into the subject of their post, clarify / substantiate their ideas or help them to improve their academic writing. Please see the relevant artifact for further details. <br><br>

                        I find the discussions a useful tool to develop my critical thinking / writing skills as this is something that has been criticised in past modules. Going forward, I will continue to look for opportunities to improve these skills since it seems more challenging to find ‘opposing views’ in more technical areas, which are those towards which I have an affinity.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Collaborative Discussion 1: Responding to Peers</strong><br><br>
                        
                        I produced an initial planning document with two ideas for my Capstone project and contacted two potential supervisors for comment. Once feedback has been received, I will start further research in the area which shows most promise.
