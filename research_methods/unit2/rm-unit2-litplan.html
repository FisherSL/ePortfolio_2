                <p><em>Guiding questions to support planning, revising, and refining of a literature review*</em></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>What is the focus and aim of your review? Who is your audience?</li>
                    <li>Why is there a need for your review? Why is it significant?</li>
                    <li>What is the context of the topic or issue? What perspective do you take? What framework do you
                        use to synthesise the literature?</li>
                    <li>How did you locate and select sources for inclusion in the review?</li>
                    <li>How is your review structured?</li>
                    <li>What are the main findings in the literature on this topic?</li>
                    <li>What are the main strengths and limitations of this literature?</li>
                    <li>Are there any discrepancies in this literature?</li>
                    <li>What conclusions do your draw from the review? What do you argue needs to be done as an outcome
                        of the review?</li>
                </ol>
                <p>* As with other sets of guiding questions in this book, select those questions that are relevant to
                    your context, add others as appropriate, and decide the order in which you will address them to
                    communicate effectively with your audience.</p>

                    <h2>Cloud security risks in a sector of your choice</h2>
                    <p>"Cloud security risks in call tracking and CRM in MarTech"</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Focus and Aim:</strong> The focus of the literature review will be to explore the
                            cloud
                            security risks specific to the call tracking and martech sector, particularly within the
                            context
                            of an EU country. The aim is to assess the implications of third-party data transfers and
                            global
                            data housing on cloud security within this industry. The primary audience includes
                            stakeholders
                            involved in cloud security, data protection, call tracking, martech, and regulatory
                            compliance.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Need and Significance:</strong> The review is necessary due to the increasing
                            reliance
                            on cloud technologies in the call tracking and martech sector, coupled with the regulatory
                            requirements imposed by the GDPR in EU countries. Understanding and mitigating cloud
                            security
                            risks are crucial for safeguarding sensitive data and maintaining compliance with data
                            protection regulations. Additionally, the global nature of data housing and third-party data
                            transfers adds complexity to cloud security practices, making this review significant for
                            industry practitioners, policymakers, and researchers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Context and Perspective:</strong> The topic of cloud security risks in call tracking
                            and
                            martech is situated within the broader context of cybersecurity, data protection
                            regulations,
                            and technological advancements. The review will adopt a practical perspective, analysis of
                            relevant frameworks, regulations, and case studies to assess the effectiveness of current
                            security measures and identify areas for improvement.</li>
                        <li><strong>Source Selection:</strong> Sources for inclusion in the review will be identified
                            through systematic searches of academic databases, industry reports, case studies,
                            regulatory
                            documents, and relevant literature on cloud security, data protection, call tracking, and
                            martech. Selection criteria included relevance to the topic, methodological rigour, and
                            geographical applicability to EU countries.</li>

                        <li><strong>Structure:</strong> The review will be structured into sections that address key
                            aspects
                            of cloud security risks in the call tracking and martech sector. These sections may include
                            an
                            overview of cloud security principles, an analysis of regulatory requirements (such as the
                            GDPR), an examination of third-party data transfer mechanisms, an assessment of global data
                            housing practices, case studies illustrating security incidents or best practices, and
                            recommendations for mitigating risks.</li>

                            data
                            transfers, some mention of 3rd party data management with APIs, challenges in ensuring
                            compliance with GDPR requirements, risks posed by global data housing practices, and the
                            need

                        <li><strong>Strengths and Limitations:</strong> The likely strengths of the literature will
                            include
                            comprehensive coverage of cloud security risks, detailed analyses of regulatory frameworks,
                            and
                            practical insights from industry case studies. However, limitations include gaps in research
                            on
                            emerging threats, inconsistencies in regulatory interpretations, and the evolving nature of
                            cloud technologies and martech itself, which may outpace current security practices. CRMs
                            are at
                            the forefront, and this will influence future commerce as our digital landscape explodes
                            with
                            IoT and AI as part of the internet 4.0.</li>
