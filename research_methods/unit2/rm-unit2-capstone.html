                <h2>Initial thoughts on possible capstone project</h2>
                <p>At the moment, I have two possible ideas regarding a capstone project; they are in very different areas:</p>

                <p><em>Idea 1</em> <br>
                I have developed an interest in cryptography through the course. In the Secure Systems Architecture module, the group project was based around securing IoT devices. As part of our submission, we implemented AES encryption of the data transmitted under the MQTT protocol between sensor, broker and controller. We attempted to ascertain any latency generated by this implementation by running a simulation using different cipher key lengths and found that unsurprisingly, longer key lengths generated more latency.  Since IoT devices operate in resource constrained environments with the transmission of data often time critical, I have started to formulate a project around the idea of testing various encryption algorithms under the MQTT protocol to evaluate their efficiency.</p>
                
                <p>
                Further research led to discover that with this in mind, NIST held a competition to evaluate new IoT encryption algorithms, selecting the Ascon family of algorithms as the winner (Boutin, 2023). 32 algorithms were selected for the second round of the competition of which 10 went through to the final. At this stage, I am wondering whether testing these 32 or 10 algorithms (or perhaps others which have since been proposed) for efficiency in a simulated environment written in Python could be the basis of a Capstone project. </p>

                <p><em>Idea 2</em> <br>
                Another interest of mine is governance, risk and compliance, in particular UK GDPR. The Information Commissioner’s Office is the body responsible for overseeing education and enforcement of the UK GDPR and has lots of good information on its website. Unfortunately, there is no chatbot available to easily access this information. So my other idea is to develop a chatbot specifically for small and micro businesses as they often don’t have specialists within them. <br><br>

                It is my intention to submit my idea to potential supervisors get some initial feedback.
                </p>
