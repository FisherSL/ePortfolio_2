                <h3>Exercise 9.1</h3>
                <p><em>Open the Excel workbook in Exa 9.1D.xlsx from the Exercises folder. This contains the
                    percentage frequencies together with the bar chart just created in the above example. Add a
                    percentage frequency bar chart showing the brand preferences in Area 2, using the same format
                    as that employed for the Area1 results in the above example. Drag your new chart so that it lies
                    alongside that for Area 1.<br><br>
                    Briefly interpret your findings. What do these results tell you about the patterns of brand
                    preferences for each of the two demographic areas?</em></p>

                <h4>Analysis</h4>
                <img src="Exercise_9.1.png">

                <h4>Interpretation</h4>

                <p>It's clear from the bar chart that Area 2 shows the same trend in cereal preference as Area 1.<br><br>

                It's important to note, however that comparisons between the two areas using the charts alone is problematic due to the difference in the scales chosen by the software for the y axis. For example, on first examination you could be forgiven for thinking that the % preference for 'Other' is about the same in both areas since the bars look similar lengths. It is only after closely examining the scales that it can be determined that this is not the case (Area 1=60%, Area 2 = 46%)

                <h3>Exercise 9.2</h3>

                <p><em>Open the Excel workbook in Exa 9.2E.xlsx from the Exercises folder. This contains the frequency
                    distributions for Data Set E (see the Data Annexe) to which has been added the corresponding
                    percentage frequency distributions. Complete a percentage frequency clustered column bar chart
                    showing the heather species prevalence in the two different locations. Briefly interpret your
                    findings.</em></p>

                    <h4>Artifact</h4>
                    <img src="Exercise_9.2.png">
    
                    <h4>Analysis</h4>

                    <p>It is clear that there are more favourable areas for Heather to grow in Location A than in location B since it's presence was found in more transepts in location A (whether sparse or abundant). Location B had 3 times the transects where heather did not grow at all compared to location A.<br><br>

                    The results suggest that more data regarding the biotic and abiotic factors in each location are required to comment further. e..g if Location B had bodies of water in it, some transects may have passed through those and since heather is a terrestial plant, the comparison is not necessarily a fair one. It would depend on what was trying to be achieved in this study.

                <h3>Exercise 9.3</h3>

                <p><em>Open the Excel workbook in Exa 9.3B.xlsx from the Exercises folder. This contains the relative
                    frequency histogram for the Diet A weight loss produced in Example 9.3 together with some of the
                    Diet B weight loss summary statistics. Add a relative frequency histogram of the weight loss for Diet
                    B, where possible using the same classes as those employed for the Diet A results in the above
                    example.<br><br>
                    Briefly interpret your histogram. What do these results tell you about the patterns of weight loss for
                    each of the two diets?</em></p>

                <h4>Analysis</h4>
                <img src="Exercise_9.3.png">

                <p>The distribution for Diet B is unimodal but skewed to the right since the total frequency of weights greater than the mean is higher than those lower than the mean. On this evidence it would seem that diet B is most effective since more people lost weight than gained but there is a much greater range of effectiveness</p>
