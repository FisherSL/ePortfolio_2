                <h2>Reflecting on Unit 9</h2>
                </header>
                <section>
                    <p>In Unit 9, we focused on understanding the critical concepts of validity, generalisability, and
                        reliability in research. These concepts are essential for ensuring the credibility and
                        applicability of research findings. The unit emphasised the importance of considering these
                        factors before collecting any data to ensure accurate and meaningful results.</p>
                    <p>The unit explored the differences between qualitative and quantitative data and highlighted the
                        importance of planning data analysis and presentation methods beforehand. Quantitative data
                        often leads to descriptive and inferential statistics, while qualitative data requires thorough
                        data cleansing and validation processes.</p>
                    <p>Reliability refers to the consistency of the measurement process, while validity ensures that the
                        measurement targets the correct concept. A reliable measurement process is a prerequisite for
                        assessing validity, which is a broader and more complex concept.</p>
                    <h2>Key Takeaways:</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Validity and Reliability:</strong> Understanding the importance of ensuring both
                            reliability and validity in research to draw accurate conclusions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Generalisability:</strong> Recognising how findings from a sample can be applicable
                            to a larger population.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Analysis Planning:</strong> The necessity of planning data analysis and
                            presentation methods before data collection.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h2>Summary of Activities</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Solo Lecturecast:</strong> Engaged in solo learning through the lecturecast, which
                            discussed validity, generalisability, and reliability.</li>
                        <li><strong>Worksheets:</strong> Completed the "Charts Worksheet and Analysis" in Excel,
                            including analysis and interpretation of the results.</li>
                        <li><strong>PowerBI Task:</strong> Unable to complete the PowerBI task but managed to keep up
                            with the other activities.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Unit 9 highlighted the importance of validity, generalisability, and reliability in research. The
                        worksheets were particularly useful in applying these concepts to practical scenarios, although
                        I couldn't complete the PowerBI task due to time constraints.</p>
                    <h2>So what?</h2>
                    <p>This unit underscored the need to ensure research methods are reliable and valid to produce
                        credible results. Balancing multiple tasks remains a challenge, but the practical exercises
                        helped reinforce the theoretical concepts.</p>
                    <h2>What next?</h2>
                    <p>Moving forward, I plan to refine my understanding of validity and reliability in research. I will
                        focus on integrating these concepts into my future research projects to ensure robust and
                        credible findings. Additionally, I aim to improve my time management skills to better handle
                        multiple tasks and complete all assigned activities.</p>
