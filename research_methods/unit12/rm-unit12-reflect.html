                <h2>Reflecting on Unit 12</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>In Unit 12, we focused on project management and managing risk within a project. Effective
                        project management involves controlling processes and activities related to a project,
                        particularly within computing infrastructure and information systems. We explored various
                        project management methodologies and learned that a ‘one size fits all’ approach does not work
                        due to the diverse environments and objectives of different projects.</p>
                    <p>We also discussed the importance of selecting appropriate metrics to measure project performance
                        and assessing risks, acknowledging that no project is risk-free. Risk management involves
                        identifying and planning for significant potential risks, which often are not visible at the
                        start of a project. We learned how to manage changes during a project to minimise their impact
                        on project scope, cost, and timeline while taking advantage of new opportunities.</p>
                    <h2>Key Takeaways:</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Project Management:</strong> Understanding the concept and importance of project
                            management, including the project life cycle and methodologies.</li>
                        <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> Learning how to assess, plan, and manage risks and changes
                            within a project to maintain quality and control costs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Change Management:</strong> Implementing a change control process to handle changes
                            effectively during a project.</li>
                        <li><strong>Remote Collaboration:</strong> Appreciating the technologies and software needed to
                            support remote project collaboration.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h2>Summary of Activities</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Lecturecast:</strong> Participated in a lecturecast on project management and risk
                            management.</li>
                        <li><strong>Self-Test Quiz:</strong> Completed a quiz to reinforce understanding of the unit
                            concepts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Portfolio Submission:</strong> Prepared and submitted the final e-Portfolio,
                            reflecting on learning and professional development.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Throughout the course, I found the e-Portfolio to be a valuable tool for tracking my learning and
                        professional development. However, the lack of consistency between modules regarding the
                        e-Portfolio submission was frustrating. More frequent and consistent emphasis on the e-Portfolio
                        across modules would have been helpful. As someone balancing work and study, managing the
                        numerous tasks was challenging, and I believe a more balanced workload would improve the
                        learning experience.</p>
                    <h2>So what?</h2>
                    <p>This unit highlighted the importance of effective project and risk management in ensuring project
                        success. The activities and assessments helped me develop a comprehensive understanding of
                        managing projects and handling risks, which will be invaluable in my professional practice. The
                        research proposal and literature review aspects were extremely helpful for future studies.</p>
                    <h2>What next?</h2>
                    <p>Moving forward, I will apply the project management and risk management techniques learned in
                        this unit to my professional projects. I will continue to refine my e-Portfolio to showcase my
                        skills and development. Additionally, I will advocate for more balanced workloads and consistent
                        e-Portfolio integration across modules to enhance the learning experience for future students.
