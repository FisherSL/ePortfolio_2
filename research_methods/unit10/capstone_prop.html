                <h2>Unit 10: Capstone Outline</h2>
                </header>
                <section>
                    <p>As well as the final deadline for the Unit 10 summative, we have been asked to consider starting to formalise our thoughts regarding the capstone project by considering the following areas:</p>
                        <h4>Research area and working title.</h4>
                        As the course has progressed, I have developed an interest in encryption and the unique problems of its implementation in resource constrained Internet of Things (IoT) environments. My working title is:<br><br>
                        <em>Investigating the efficacy of lightweight encryption in resources constrained IoT environments.</em>
                        <h4>Proposed Research Problem and Research Question.</h4>
                        <p>R1 – What metric of measuring the efficiency of the algorithms best reflects this use case?<br><br>
                        R2 – Which algorithm is most efficient for the proposed use case?<br><br>
                        The results of my research could help in the selection of an encryption algorithm most appropriate for a particular use case.</p>
                        <h4>Proposed Aims and Objectives.</h4>
                        To develop a system to measure efficiency. Current thoughts are this could include components of encryption time (CPU cycles? Code execution time?), energy usage, memory usage and encryption strength.<br>
                        Bharathi, et al., (2017) suggest the following for measuring the performance of an encryption algorithm:
                            <ul>
                                <li>encryption time / decryption time</li>	
                                <li>throughput of encryption / throughput of decryption</li>
                                <li>CPU process time</li>
                                <li>CPU clock cycles</li>
                                <li>power consumption</li>
                                <li>memory use</li>
                            </ul>
                        The weighting of each measure will need to be carefully considered for resource constrained IoT environments and a particular use case. For example, for a remote sensor relying on battery power, power consumption will have a higher weighting than a case where the sensor has mains power.
                        <h4>Proposed Methodology.</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Create testing bed.</li>    
                                <li>Decide on measure of efficiency.</li>
                                <li>Select algorithms [based on Bouting, (2023)?]</li>
                                <li>Test algorithms to collect data.</li>
                                <li>Process and analyse the data to answer R1 & R2.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <h4>Artefact(s) that can be created.</h4>
                            <ol>
                                <li>A physical testing environment composed of sensors, broker and controller(s).</li>
                                <li>The Python code required to implement each encryption algorithm over the MQTT protocol between sensor / controller / broker / subscriber.</li>
                            
                            </ol>
