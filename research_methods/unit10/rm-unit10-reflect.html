                </header>
                <section>
                    <p>In Unit 10, we focused on research writing, a crucial skill for communicating technical knowledge
                        effectively. This unit is particularly valuable for writing a final dissertation, research
                        proposals, and papers for peer-reviewed journals.</p>
                    <p>We covered the structure of a dissertation and how to approach each section, tying together
                        previous work on identifying research areas, conducting literature reviews, and selecting
                        appropriate research methods. This preparation culminated in the creation of a project proposal.

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Research Writing:</strong> Understanding the importance and structure of research
                            writing in presenting technical knowledge.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dissertation Structure:</strong> Learning how to organise and prepare for writing a
                            dissertation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Project Proposal:</strong> Developing a project proposal that outlines the research
                            area, problem, aims, objectives, and design.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h2>Summary of Activities</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Lecturecast:</strong> Engaged in a lecturecast on research writing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reading:</strong> Completed solo reading assignments on research writing techniques.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Project Outline:</strong> Prepared an outline for the capstone project, including
                            research area, problem, aims, objectives, and proposed design.</li>
                        <li><strong>Assessment:</strong> Completed a research proposal presentation and transcript,
                            which helped in critically evaluating literature and research design.</li>

                    <p>This unit was instrumental in mapping out my future research. The proposal presentation made my
                        project feel tangible and gave me a clearer direction for my studies. Although I didn't submit
                        the worksheets from Units 8 and 9, I found the process of developing the project outline and
                        presentation extremely beneficial.</p>
                    <h2>So what?</h2>
                    <p>Unit 10 emphasised the importance of clear and structured research writing. The preparation and
                        completion of the research proposal helped solidify my understanding of how to present my
                        research effectively. This unit has increased my confidence in planning and executing my future
                        research projects.</p>
                    <h2>What next?</h2>
                    <p>Moving forward, I will continue refining my research proposal and prepare for the capstone
                        project. The skills and knowledge gained from this unit will be invaluable in writing my
                        dissertation and future research papers. I aim to apply these principles consistently to ensure
                        my research is well-structured and effectively communicated.</p>
