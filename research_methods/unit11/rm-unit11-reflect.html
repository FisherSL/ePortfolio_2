                <h2>Reflecting on Unit 11</h2>
                </header>
                <section>
                    <p>In Unit 11, we focused on professional development through the use of our e-Portfolio. This tool
                        is due for submission in Unit 12 and is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of our
                        learning journey. An e-Portfolio is valuable across various industries and serves as a showcase
                        of our skills and knowledge.</p>
                    <p>We discussed the importance of reflecting on our learning experiences to gain insights into how
                        our learning impacts professional practice. This reflection forms the basis for completing the
                        Professional Skills matrix and developing an action plan for continuous professional development
                        (CPD). Industry certifications were also highlighted as essential for keeping our knowledge
                        up-to-date.</p>
                    <h2>Key Takeaways:</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Reflection:</strong> Understanding how reflecting on our learning process enhances
                            our professional practice.</li>
                        <li><strong>Professional Skills Matrix:</strong> Completing the matrix based on BCS guidelines
                            and Essex graduate attributes to assess and plan our professional development.</li>
                        <li><strong>Continuous Professional Development (CPD):</strong> Recognising the importance of
                            CPD and industry certifications.</li>
                        <li><strong>Learning Loop:</strong> Using this tool to review our degree programme and plan
                            future development.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h2>Summary of Activities</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Lecturecast:</strong> Participated in a lecturecast on professional development and
                            e-Portfolio preparation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Professional Skills Matrix:</strong> Reviewed and completed the matrix,
                            incorporating evidence from various modules and personal accomplishments.</li>
                        <li><strong>SWOT Analysis:</strong> Conducted a SWOT analysis to inform our action plan for
                            professional development.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reflection:</strong> Reflected on a specific module that significantly impacted our
                            professional practice.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Despite the challenges of attending live seminars due to non-standardised times, I engaged in the
                        matrix assessment and reflection activities. The lack of consistent opportunities for formative
                        feedback outside of seminars is frustrating, making it harder to keep up with an online course.
                        However, these activities have been crucial in preparing my e-Portfolio and planning my
                        professional development.</p>
                    <h2>So what?</h2>
                    <p>This unit emphasised the importance of continuous professional development and the role of
                        reflection in enhancing professional practice. The activities and assessments helped me
                        critically evaluate my skills and plan for future growth.</p>
                    <h2>What next?</h2>
                    <p>Moving forward, I will finalise my e-Portfolio and ensure it comprehensively showcases my
                        learning and skills. I will continue to pursue industry certifications to stay current and
                        relevant in my field. Additionally, I will advocate for more consistent seminar scheduling and
                        alternative feedback opportunities to better support my learning experience.</p>
