                <h2>Unit 11: Reflections</h2>
                <p>The main tasks this week was continuing professional development including the artifacts included in the eportfolio of a skills matrix, SWOT analysis and action plan. Whilst I appreciate that this is standard practice in many industries, I have had too many negative experiences in my professional life with this kind of thing to find any enthusiasm for them. <br><br>Whilst I can see the benefit form a human resources and management perspective, completing them did not really tell me anything I didn’t already know about myself or what I now need to do, but I suppose at least I do have it in writing instead of just in my head, so maybe that’s something!</p>
