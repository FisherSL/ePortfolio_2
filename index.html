            <p>
                Thank you for viewing my portfolio. This way you can learn a bit more about me and my skills. I am a
                very multifaceted skilled worker, with a background in chemistry, pharmacy, web design, instructional
                design, and cybersecurity. I have never shied away from a task, and studying is my passion. This is why
                I love working in learning technology while studying! I develop postgraduate courses for my current job,
                which involves collaborating with academics. In addition, I study Cybersecurity in my time away from
                work; computing has always been an interest for me. I have created this portfolio to portray my journey
                and show my building block of knowledge for the future of security technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, I cannot include everything in this portfolio, so please send me an email if you'd like to
                see more or discuss any opportunities.
            </p>
